	Abstract = {Systems biology can unravel complex biology but has not been extensively applied to human newborns, a group highly vulnerable to a wide range of diseases. We optimized methods to extract transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, cytokine/chemokine, and single cell immune phenotyping data from <1 ml of blood, a volume readily obtained from newborns. Indexing to baseline and applying innovative integrative computational methods reveals dramatic changes along a remarkably stable developmental trajectory over the first week of life. This is most evident in changes of interferon and complement pathways, as well as neutrophil-associated signaling. Validated across two independent cohorts of newborns from West Africa and Australasia, a robust and common trajectory emerges, suggesting a purposeful rather than random developmental path. Systems biology and innovative data integration can provide fresh insights into the molecular ontogeny of the first week of life, a dynamic developmental phase that is key for health and disease.},

	Abstract = {Loading control (LC) and variance stabilization of reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) data have been challenging mainly due to the small number of proteins in an experiment and the lack of reliable inherent control markers. In this study, we compare eight different normalization methods for LC and variance stabilization. The invariant marker set concept was first applied to the normalization of high-throughput gene expression data. A set of "invariant" markers are selected to create a virtual reference sample. Then all the samples are normalized to the virtual reference. We propose a variant of this method in the context of RPPA data normalization and compare it with seven other normalization methods previously reported in the literature. The invariant marker set method performs well with respect to LC, variance stabilization and association with the immunohistochemistry/florescence in situ hybridization data for three key markers in breast tumor samples, while the other methods have inferior performance. The proposed method is a promising approach for improving the quality of RPPA data.},

@article{Lim2017,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective kinase and immune checkpoint inhibitors, and their combinations, have significantly improved the survival of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. Not all patients will respond to treatment however, and some patients will present with significant toxicities. Hence, the identification of biomarkers is critical for the selection and management of patients receiving treatment. Biomarker discovery often involves proteomic techniques that simultaneously profile multiple proteins but few studies have compared these platforms. METHODS: In this study, we used the multiplex bead-based Eve Technologies Discovery assay and the aptamer-based SomaLogic SOMAscan assay to identify circulating proteins predictive of response to immunotherapy in melanoma patients treated with combination immune checkpoint inhibitors. Expression of four plasma proteins were further validated using the bead-based Millipore Milliplex assay. RESULTS: Both the Discovery and the SOMAscan assays detected circulating plasma proteins in immunotherapy-treated melanoma patients. However, these widely used assays showed limited correlation in relative protein quantification, due to differences in specificity and the dynamic range of protein detection. Protein data derived from the Discovery and Milliplex bead-based assays were highly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights significant limitations imposed by inconsistent sensitivity and specificity due to differences in the detection antibodies or aptamers of these widespread biomarker discovery approaches. Our findings emphasize the need to improve these technologies for the accurate identification of biomarkers.},

@article{Wu2017,
	Abstract = {The quantitative measurement of the proteome has been shown to yield new insights into physiology and cell biology that cannot be determined from the genome and transcriptome because the quantitative relationship between transcriptome and proteome is complex. MS-based proteomics techniques, such as SWATH-MS, have recently advanced to the point at which they may be reliably applied by biologists who are not specialists in mass spectrometry. Here we provide standard protocols for preparation of tissue samples for input into the SWATH-MS analytical pipeline. These protocols are designed for high-throughput processing of tissues with ≥5 mg of sample available for analysis. Studies with extremely limited amounts of tissue should consider PCT-SWATH. An experienced single user should be able to process 48 samples per day for injection into the mass spectrometer, or up to 144 samples a week. The machine time necessary for running these samples with SWATH is approximately 1.5 hr per sample. Data acquisition protocols are also provided. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

@article{Williams2018,
	Abstract = {We have used SWATH mass spectrometry to quantify 3648 proteins across 76 proteomes collected from genetically-diverse BXD mouse strains in two fractions (mitochondria and total cell) from five tissues: liver, quadriceps, heart, brain, and brown adipose (BAT). Across tissues, expression covariation between genes' proteins and transcripts-measured in the same individuals-broadly aligned. Covariation was however far stronger in certain subsets than others: only 8{\%} of transcripts in the lowest expression and variance quintile covaried with their protein, in contrast to 65{\%} of transcripts in the highest quintiles. Key functional differences among the 3648 genes were also observed across tissues, with electron transport chain (ETC) genes particularly investigated. ETC complex proteins covary and form strong gene networks according to tissue, but their equivalent transcripts do not. Certain physiological consequences, such as the depletion of ATP synthase in BAT, are thus obscured in transcript data. Lastly, we compared the quantitative proteomic measurements between the total cell and mitochondrial fractions for the five tissues. The resulting enrichment score highlighted several hundred proteins which were strongly enriched in mitochondria, which included several dozen proteins were not reported in literature to be mitochondrially localized. Four of these candidates were selected for biochemical validation, where we found MTAP, SOAT2, and IMPDH2 to be localized inside the mitochondria, while ABCC6 was in the mitochondria-associated membrane. These findings demonstrate the synergies of a multi-omics approach to study complex metabolic processes, and this provides a resource for further discovery and analysis of proteoforms, modified proteins, and protein localization.},

	Abstract = {The complex and bi-directional relationship linking the liver and diabetes has recently gained intense new interest. This critical review of the published work aims to highlight the most recent basic and clinical data underlying the development of type 2 diabetes, in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, the potentially detrimental effects of type 2 diabetes in liver injury are also discussed in each of the two sections of the present paper. Fatty liver and diabetes share insulin resistance as their chief pathogenic determinant. The roles of the hypothalamus, the intestinal microbiome, white adipose tissue and inflammation are discussed in detail. Molecular insights into hepatocyte insulin resistance as the initiator of systemic insulin resistance are also presented with full coverage of the danger of fatty acids. Lipotoxicity, apoptosis, lipoautophagy, endoplasmic reticular stress response and recent developments in genetics are discussed. Closing the circle, special emphasis is given to biochemical pathways and clinical evidence supporting the role of type 2 diabetes as a risk factor for the development of progressive liver disease, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. In conclusion, data support non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes which is, in turn, a major contributor to progressive liver disease. This pathway leading from fatty liver to type 2 diabetes and back from the latter to the progressive liver disease is a vicious circle.},

@article{Canbay2007,
	Abstract = {As a key metabolic organ, the liver is central to the imbalance of high-caloric diets, and particularly dietary fat consumption, in the industrialized countries and their association with the increasing prevalence of morbid obesity. By interacting with the intestinal tract and adipose tissue, the liver plays a key role in various aspects of lipid metabolism. Increasing activation of transcription factors, such as carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), sterol response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), or forkhead box 01 (Fox01), may contribute to fatty acid synthesis. Their translocation occurs via fatty acid transporters such as fatty acid transport proteins (FATP), fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), caveolin-1 and fatty acid binding protein (FABP) . Eventually, the accumulation of fat in the form of lipid droplets within the hepatocytes results in hepatic steatosis which, indeed, is a hallmark of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic fatty liver, acute fatty liver in pregnancy, and hepatitis C. In contrast, lipid accumulation within hepatocytes during liver regeneration is essential. It is thus now becoming clear that steatosis is not only a mere consequence of metabolic imbalance, but that it is also a result of discrete alterations in the beta-oxidation, transport mechanisms, and signaling pathways involved in the synthesis, systemic traffic modalities, and cellular effects of fatty acids. Such a novel insight offers potential options for improved treatment.},

	Abstract = {Information about normal hepatic glucose metabolism may help to understand pathogenic mechanisms underlying obesity and diabetes mellitus. In addition, liver glucose metabolism is involved in glycosylation reactions and connected with fatty acid metabolism. The liver receives dietary carbohydrates directly from the intestine via the portal vein. Glucokinase phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate inside the hepatocyte, ensuring that an adequate flow of glucose enters the cell to be metabolized. Glucose 6-phosphate may proceed to several metabolic pathways. During the post-prandial period, most glucose 6-phosphate is used to synthesize glycogen via the formation of glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-glucose. Minor amounts of UDP-glucose are used to form UDP-glucuronate and UDP-galactose, which are donors of monosaccharide units used in glycosylation. A second pathway of glucose 6-phosphate metabolism is the formation of fructose 6-phosphate, which may either start the hexosamine pathway to produce UDP-N-acetylglucosamine or follow the glycolytic pathway to generate pyruvate and then acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA may enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to be oxidized or may be exported to the cytosol to synthesize fatty acids, when excess glucose is present within the hepatocyte. Finally, glucose 6-phosphate may produce NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate through the pentose phosphate pathway. Glucose metabolism supplies intermediates for glycosylation, a post-translational modification of proteins and lipids that modulates their activity. Congenital deficiency of phosphoglucomutase (PGM)-1 and PGM-3 is associated with impaired glycosylation. In addition to metabolize carbohydrates, the liver produces glucose to be used by other tissues, from glycogen breakdown or from de novo synthesis using primarily lactate and alanine (gluconeogenesis).},

	Abstract = {Metabolomics is a powerful tool for understanding phenotypes and discovering biomarkers. Combinations of multiple batches or data sets in large cross-sectional epidemiology studies are frequently utilized in metabolomics, but various systematic biases can introduce both batch and injection order effects and often require proper calibrations prior to chemometric analyses. We present a novel algorithm, Batch Normalizer, to calibrate large scale metabolomic data. Batch Normalizer utilizes a regression model with consideration of the total abundance of each sample to improve its calibration performance, and it is able to remove both batch effect and injection order effects. This calibration method was tested using liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) chromatograms of 228 plasma samples and 23 pooled quality control (QC) samples. We evaluated the performance of Batch Normalizer by examining the distribution of relative standard deviation (RSD) for all peaks detected in the pooled QC samples, the average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks between any two of QC samples, and the distribution of QC samples in the scores plot of a principal component analysis (PCA). After calibration by Batch Normalizer, the number of peaks in QC samples with RSD less than 15{\%} increased from 11 to 914, all of the QC samples were closely clustered in PCA scores plot, and the average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks of QC samples increased from 0.938 to 0.976. This method was compared to 7 commonly used calibration methods. We discovered that using Batch Normalizer to calibrate LC/TOF-MS data produces the best calibration results.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: To demonstrate robust detection of biomarkers in broad-mass-range TOF-MS data. Experimental Design: Spectra were obtained for two serum protein profiling studies: (i) 2-200 kDa for 132 patients, 67 healthy and 65 diagnosed as having adult T-cell leukemia and (ii) 2-100 kDa for 140 patients, 70 pairs, each with matched prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of one benign and one prostate cancer. Signal processing was performed on raw spectra and peak data were normalized using four methods. Feature selection was performed using Bayesian Network Analysis and a classifier was tested on withheld data. Identification of candidate biomarkers was pursued. Results: Integrated peak intensities were resolved over full spectra. Normalization using local noise values was superior to global methods in reducing peak correlations, reducing replicate variability and improving feature selection stability. For the leukemia data set, potential disease biomarkers were detected and were found to be predictive for withheld data. Preliminary assignments of protein IDs were consistent with published results and LC-MS/MS identification. No prostate-specific-antigen-independent biomarkers were detected in the prostate cancer data set. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Signal processing, local signal-to-noise (SNR) normalization and Bayesian Network Analysis feature selection facilitate robust detection and identification of biomarker proteins in broad-mass-range clinical TOF-MS data.},

@article{Smyth2004,
	Abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

@article{Nygaard2016,
	Abstract = {Removal of, or adjustment for, batch effects or center differences is generally required when such effects are present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

Normalizing the data by filtering out the eigengenes (and eigenarrays) that are inferred to represent noise or experimental artifacts enables meaningful comparison of the expression of different genes across different arrays in different experiments. Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

	Abstract = {To overcome random experimental variation, even for simple screens, data from multiple microarrays have to be combined. There are, however, systematic differences between arrays, and any bias remaining after experimental measures to ensure consistency needs to be controlled for. It is often difficult to make the right choice of data transformation and normalisation methods to achieve this end. In this tutorial paper we review the problem and a selection of solutions, explaining the basic principles behind normalisation procedures and providing guidance for their application.},

@article{Ghandi2012,
	Abstract = {Data normalization is a crucial preliminary step in analyzing genomic datasets. The goal of normalization is to remove global variation to make readings across different experiments comparable. In addition, most genomic loci have non-uniform sensitivity to any given assay because of variation in local sequence properties. In microarray experiments, this non-uniform sensitivity is due to different DNA hybridization and cross-hybridization efficiencies, known as the probe effect. In this paper we introduce a new scheme, called Group Normalization (GN), to remove both global and local biases in one integrated step, whereby we determine the normalized probe signal by finding a set of reference probes with similar responses. Compared to conventional normalization methods such as Quantile normalization and physically motivated probe effect models, our proposed method is general in the sense that it does not require the assumption that the underlying signal distribution be identical for the treatment and control, and is flexible enough to correct for nonlinear and higher order probe effects. The Group Normalization algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement. We also describe a variant of the Group Normalization algorithm, called Cross Normalization, which efficiently amplifies biologically relevant differences between any two genomic datasets.},

@article{Calza2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that the normalization step of microarray data makes a difference in the downstream analysis. All normalization methods rely on certain assumptions, so differences in results can be traced to different sensitivities to violation of the assumptions. Illustrating the lack of robustness, in a striking spike-in experiment all existing normalization methods fail because of an imbalance between up- and down-regulated genes. This means it is still important to develop a normalization method that is robust against violation of the standard assumptions RESULTS: We develop a new algorithm based on identification of the least-variant set (LVS) of genes across the arrays. The array-to-array variation is evaluated in the robust linear model fit of pre-normalized probe-level data. The genes are then used as a reference set for a non-linear normalization. The method is applicable to any existing expression summaries, such as MAS5 or RMA. CONCLUSION: We show that LVS normalization outperforms other normalization methods when the standard assumptions are not satisfied. In the complex spike-in study, LVS performs similarly to the ideal (in practice unknown) housekeeping-gene normalization. An R package called lvs is available in http://www.meb.ki.se/{\~{}}yudpaw.},

@article{Ni2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND High-throughput microarrays are widely used to study gene expression across tissues and developmental stages. Analysis of gene expression data is challenging in these experiments due to the presence of significant percentages of differentially expressed genes (DEG) observed between tissues and developmental stages. Data normalization methods that are widely used today are not designed for data with a large proportion of tissue or gene effects. RESULTS In our current study, we describe a novel two-dimensional nonparametric normalization method for analyzing microarray data which functions well in the absence or presence of large numbers of gene effects. Rather than relying on an assumption of low variability among most genes, the method implements a unique peak selection strategy to distinguish DEG from genes that are invariant in expression, prior to nonlinear curve fitting. We compared the method under simulated and experimental conditions with five alternative nonlinear normalization approaches: quantile, lowess, robust lowess, invariant set, and cross-correlation (Xcorr). Simulations included various percentages of simulated DEG and the experimental data used is from publicly available datasets known to be difficult to analyze due to the presence of approximately 34{\%} DEG. CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that the new method provides considerable improvement in the accuracy of data normalization when large proportions of gene effects are present. The performance improvement is mostly attributed to its variable selection component, which is designed to separate expression invariant genes from DEG. Adding this key component of the new method to alternative normalization approaches rescues the most of the sensitivity of these methods to gene effects. The results indicate that our method may be used without prior knowledge of or assumptions about housekeeping genes to normalize microarrays that are quite different.},

	Abstract = {Normalization is essential to get rid of biases in microarray data for their accurate analysis. Existing normalization methods for microarray gene expression data commonly assume a similar global expression pattern among samples being studied. However, scenarios of global shifts in gene expressions are dominant in cancers, making the assumption invalid. To alleviate the problem, here we propose and develop a novel normalization strategy, Cross Normalization (CrossNorm), for microarray data with unbalanced transcript levels among samples. Conventional procedures, such as RMA and LOESS, arbitrarily flatten the difference between case and control groups leading to biased gene expression estimates. Noticeably, applying these methods under the strategy of CrossNorm, which makes use of the overall statistics of the original signals, the results showed significantly improved robustness and accuracy in estimating transcript level dynamics for a series of publicly available datasets, including titration experiment, simulated data, spike-in data and several real-life microarray datasets across various types of cancers. The results have important implications for the past and the future cancer studies based on microarray samples with non-negligible difference. Moreover, the strategy can also be applied to other sorts of high-throughput data as long as the experiments have global expression variations between conditions.},

	Abstract = {Genome projects now generate large-scale data often produced at various time points by different laboratories using multiple platforms. This increases the potential for batch effects. Currently there are several batch evaluation methods like principal component analysis (PCA; mostly based on visual inspection), and sometimes they fail to reveal all of the underlying batch effects. These methods can also lead to the risk of unintentionally correcting biologically interesting factors attributed to batch effects. Here we propose a novel statistical method, finding batch effect (findBATCH), to evaluate batch effect based on probabilistic principal component and covariates analysis (PPCCA). The same framework also provides a new approach to batch correction, correcting batch effect (correctBATCH), which we have shown to be a better approach to traditional PCA-based correction. We demonstrate the utility of these methods using two different examples (breast and colorectal cancers) by merging gene expression data from different studies after diagnosing and correcting for batch effects and retaining the biological effects. These methods, along with conventional visual inspection-based PCA, are available as a part of an R package exploring batch effect (exploBATCH; https://github.com/syspremed/exploBATCH ).},

To advance the understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationships towards the level of biochemical processes, we perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of a complex quantitative phenotype. We quantify the variation of wing imaginal disc proteomes in Drosophila genetic reference panel (DGRP) lines using SWATH mass spectrometry. In spite of the very large genetic variation (1/36 bp) between the lines, proteome variability is surprisingly small, indicating strong molecular resilience of protein expression patterns. Proteins associated with adult wing size form tight co-variation clusters that are enriched in fundamental biochemical processes. Wing size correlates with some basic metabolic functions, positively with glucose metabolism but negatively with mitochondrial respiration and not with ribosome biogenesis. Our study highlights the power of PWAS to filter functional variants from the large genetic variability in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION Numerous competing algorithms for prediction in high-dimensional settings have been developed in the statistical and machine-learning literature. Learning algorithms and the prediction models they generate are typically evaluated on the basis of cross-validation error estimates in a few exemplary datasets. However, in most applications, the ultimate goal of prediction modeling is to provide accurate predictions for independent samples obtained in different settings. Cross-validation within exemplary datasets may not adequately reflect performance in the broader application context. METHODS We develop and implement a systematic approach to 'cross-study validation', to replace or supplement conventional cross-validation when evaluating high-dimensional prediction models in independent datasets. We illustrate it via simulations and in a collection of eight estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer microarray gene-expression datasets, where the objective is predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We computed the C-index for all pairwise combinations of training and validation datasets. We evaluate several alternatives for summarizing the pairwise validation statistics, and compare these to conventional cross-validation. RESULTS Our data-driven simulations and our application to survival prediction with eight breast cancer microarray datasets, suggest that standard cross-validation produces inflated discrimination accuracy for all algorithms considered, when compared to cross-study validation. Furthermore, the ranking of learning algorithms differs, suggesting that algorithms performing best in cross-validation may be suboptimal when evaluated through independent validation. AVAILABILITY The survHD: Survival in High Dimensions package (http://www.bitbucket.org/lwaldron/survhd) will be made available through Bioconductor.},

	Abstract = {A training set of data has been used to construct a rule for predicting future responses. What is the error rate of this rule? This is an important question both for comparing models and for assessing a final selected model. The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased but can be highly variable. Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include "smooth" prediction rules like Fisher's linear discriminant function and unsmooth ones like nearest neighbors.},

Biomedical data can come from different biological origins, data acquisition technologies, and clinical applications. Integrating such data across multiple scales (e.g., molecular, cellular/tissue, and patient) can lead to more informed decisions for personalized, predictive, and preventive medicine. However, data heterogeneity, community standards in data acquisition, and computational complexity are big challenges for such decision making. This review describes genomic and proteomic (i.e., molecular), histopathological imaging (i.e., cellular/tissue), and clinical (i.e., patient) data; it includes case studies for single-scale (e.g., combining genomic or histopathological image data), multiscale (e.g., combining histopathological image and clinical data), and multiscale and multiplatform (e.g., the Human Protein Atlas and The Cancer Genome Atlas) data integration. Numerous opportunities exist in biomedical informatics research focusing on integration of multiscale and multiplatform data.},

To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.},

OpenSWATH is popular open-source software for peptide identification and quan-tification from SWATH-MS data. For downstream statistical and quantitative analysis there exist different tools such as MSstats, mapDIA and aLFQ. However, the transfer of data from OpenSWATH to the downstream statistical tools is currently technically challenging. Here we introduce the R/Bioconductor package SWATH2stats, which allows convenient pro-cessing of the data into a format directly readable by the downstream analysis tools. In addi-tion, SWATH2stats allows annotation, analyzing the variation and the reproducibility of the measurements, FDR estimation, and advanced filtering before submitting the processed data to downstream tools. These functionalities are important to quickly analyze the quality of the SWATH-MS data. Hence, SWATH2stats is a new open-source tool that summarizes several practical functionalities for analyzing, processing, and converting SWATH-MS data and thus facilitates the efficient analysis of large-scale SWATH/DIA datasets.},

	Abstract = {Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for deep and reliable exploration of the (human) proteome. Targeted mass spectrometry reliably detects and quantifies pre-determined sets of proteins in a complex biological matrix and is used in studies that rely on the quantitatively accurate and reproducible measurement of proteins across multiple samples. It requires the one-time, a priori generation of a specific measurement assay for each targeted protein. SWATH-MS is a mass spectrometric method that combines data-independent acquisition (DIA) and targeted data analysis and vastly extends the throughput of proteins that can be targeted in a sample compared to selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Here we present a compendium of highly specific assays covering more than 10,000 human proteins and enabling their targeted analysis in SWATH-MS datasets acquired from research or clinical specimens. This resource supports the confident detection and quantification of 50.9{\%} of all human proteins annotated by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and is therefore expected to find wide application in basic and clinical research. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (PXD000953-954) and SWATHAtlas (SAL00016-35).},

@article{Tabb2007,
	Abstract = {Shotgun proteomics experiments are dependent upon database search engines to identify peptides from tandem mass spectra. Many of these algorithms score potential identifications by evaluating the number of fragment ions matched between each peptide sequence and an observed spectrum. These systems, however, generally do not distinguish between matching an intense peak and matching a minor peak. We have developed a statistical model to score peptide matches that is based upon the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. This scorer, part of the " MyriMatch " database search engine, places greater emphasis on matching intense peaks. The probability that the best match for each spectrum has occurred by random chance can be employed to separate correct matches from random ones. We evaluated this software on data sets from three different laboratories employing three different ion trap instruments. Employing a novel system for testing discrimination, we demonstrate that stratifying peaks into multiple intensity classes improves the discrimination of scoring. We compare MyriMatch results to those of Sequest and X!Tandem, revealing that it is capable of higher discrimination than either of these algorithms. When minimal peak filtering is employed, performance plummets for a scoring model that does not stratify matched peaks by intensity. On the other hand, we find that MyriMatch discrimination improves as more peaks are retained in each spectrum. MyriMatch also scales well to tandem mass spectra from high-resolution mass analyzers. These findings may indicate limitations for existing database search scorers that count matched peaks without differentiating them by intensity.

	Abstract = {Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be com pared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

The data, derived at great expense, can have very little value if careful attention is not paid to the experimental design and analysis. Using examples from surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) experiments, we describe several experimental design issues that can corrupt a dataset. Fortunately, the problems we identify can be avoided if attention is paid to potential sources of bias before the experiment is run.

This observation was surprising, as it contradicted much of the comparative gene regulatory data collected previously, as well as the common notion that major developmental pathways are highly conserved across a wide range of species, in particular across mammals. Here we show that the Mouse ENCODE gene expression data were collected using a flawed study design, which confounded sequencing batch (namely, the assignment of samples to sequencing flowcells and lanes) with species. When we account for the batch effect, the corrected comparative gene expression data from human and mouse tend to cluster by tissue, not by species.},

@article{Ein-Dor2006,
	Abstract = {Predicting at the time of discovery the prognosis and metastatic potential of cancer is a major challenge in current clinical research. Numerous recent studies searched for gene expression signatures that outperform traditionally used clinical parameters in outcome prediction. Finding such a signature will free many patients of the suffering and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy given to them under current protocols, even though they do not need such treatment. A reliable set of predictive genes also will contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanism of metastasis. Several groups have published lists of predictive genes and reported good predictive performance based on them. However, the gene lists obtained for the same clinical types of patients by different groups differed widely and had only very few genes in common. This lack of agreement raised doubts about the reliability and robustness of the reported predictive gene lists, and the main source of the problem was shown to be the small number of samples that were used to generate the gene lists. Here, we introduce a previously undescribed mathematical method, probably approximately correct (PAC) sorting, for evaluating the robustness of such lists. We calculate for several published data sets the number of samples that are needed to achieve any desired level of reproducibility. For example, to achieve a typical overlap of 50{\%} between two predictive lists of genes, breast cancer studies would need the expression profiles of several thousand early discovery patients.},

@article{Wang2005,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND Genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients with lymph-node-negative breast cancer. METHODS We analysed, with Affymetrix Human U133a GeneChips, the expression of 22000 transcripts from total RNA of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment. FINDINGS In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (ER) and 16 genes for ER-negative patients. This signature showed 93{\%} sensitivity and 48{\%} specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5.67 [95{\%} CI 2.59-12.4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5.55 [2.46-12.5]). The 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9.60 [2.28-40.5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4.04 [1.57-10.4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20 mm (14.1 [3.34-59.2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult. INTERPRETATION The identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant recurrence. The ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.},

	Abstract = {Cancer is mostly incurable when diagnosed at a metastatic stage, making its early detection via blood proteins of immense clinical interest. Proteomic changes in tumor tissue may lead to changes detectable in the protein composition of circulating blood plasma. Using a proteomic workflow combining N-glycosite enrichment and SWATH mass spectrometry, we generate a data resource of 284 blood samples derived from patients with different types of localized-stage carcinomas and from matched controls. We observe whether the changes in the patient's plasma are specific to a particular carcinoma or represent a generic signature of proteins modified uniformly in a common, systemic response to many cancers. A quantitative comparison of the resulting N-glycosite profiles discovers that proteins related to blood platelets are common to several cancers (e.g., THBS1), whereas others are highly cancer-type specific. Available proteomics data, including a SWATH library to study N-glycoproteins, will facilitate follow-up biomarker research into early cancer detection. Sajic et al. perform a multi-tumor plasma proteomic study in which they enrich and analyze tissue-secreted plasma glycoproteins to examine blood protein changes in early-stage localized cancers. They demonstrate that many proteins secreted upon platelet activation are changed in several tissue carcinomas, whereas others have changes specific to a single carcinoma type.},

@article{Krzywinski2014b,
	Abstract = {For studies with hierarchical noise sources, use a nested analysis of variance approach. Many studies are affected by random-noise sources that naturally fall into a hierarchy, such as the biological variation among animals, tissues and cells, or technical variation such as measurement error. With a nested approach, the variation introduced at each hierarchy layer is assessed relative to the layer below it. We can use the relative noise contribution of each layer to optimally allocate experimental resources using nested analysis of variance (ANOVA), which gener-ally addresses replication and blocking, previously discussed ad hoc 1,2 . Recall that factors are independent variables whose values we control and wish to study 3 and which have systematic effects on the response. Noise limits our ability to detect effects, but known noise sources (e.g., cell culture) can be mitigated if used as blocking factors 2 . We can model the contribution of each blocking factor to the over-all variability, isolate it and increase power 2 . Statisticians distinguish between fixed factors, typically treatments, and random factors, such as blocks. The impact of fixed and random factors in the presence of experi-mental error is shown in Figure 1. For a fixed factor (Fig. 1a), each of its levels (for example, a specific drug) has the same effect in all experi-ments and an unmodeled uncertainty due to experimental error. The levels of a fixed factor can be exactly duplicated (level A1 in Fig. 1a is identical for each experiment) and are of specific interest, usually the effect on the population mean. In contrast, when we repeat an experiment, the levels of a random factor are sampled from a population of all possible levels of the factor (replicates) and are different across all the experiments, emphasized by unique level labels (B1--B9; Fig. 1b). Because the levels cannot be exactly duplicated, their effect is random and they are not of specific interest. Instead, we use the sample of levels to model the uncertainty added by the random factor (for example, all mice). Fixed and random factors may be crossed or nested (Fig. 2). When crossed, all combinations of factors are used to study the main effects and interactions of two or more factors (Fig. 2a). In contrast, nested designs apply a hierarchy---some level combi-nations are not studied because the levels cannot be duplicated or reused (Fig. 2b). Random factors (for example, mouse and cell) are nested within the fixed factor (drug) to measure noise due to individual mice and cells and to generalize the effects of the fixed factor on all mice and cells. If mice can be reused, we can cross them with the drug and use them as a random blocking factor 2 (Fig. 2c). We will use the design in Figure 2b to illustrate the analysis of nested fixed and random factors using nested ANOVA, similar to the ANOVA discussed previously 2 . Now nesting is taken into account and the calculations have different interpretations because some of the factors are random. The fixed factor may have an effect on the mean, and the two random factors will add uncertainty. We will be able to estimate the amount of variance for each random factor and use it to better plan our replication strategy. We can maximize power (for example, within cost constraints) to detect a difference in means due to the top-level fixed factor or to detect variability due to random fac-tors. The latter is biologically interesting when increased variance in cell response may be due to increased heterogeneity in the genotypes and implicated in drug resistance. We will simulate the nested design in Figure 2b using three factors: A (a = 2 levels: control and treatment), B (mice, b = 5 levels, s B 2 = 1), C (cells, c = 5 levels, s C 2 = 2). Expression for each cell will be measured using three technical replicates (s $\epsilon$ 2 = 0.5, n = 3). The raw sample data of the simulation are shown in Figure 3a.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. AVAILABILITY The Dynamic Tree Cut method is implemented in an R package available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Langfelder2008,
	Abstract = {Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at

	Abstract = {Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variations in disease progression and clinical outcomes. The advent of next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) has generated data from patients that can be analysed to develop a predictive model. In this study, we have adopted a machine learning approach to identify biomarkers and build classifiers to discriminate between early and late stages of PRCC from gene expression profiles. A machine learning pipeline incorporating different feature selection algorithms and classification models is developed to analyse RNA sequencing dataset (RNASeq). Further, to get a reliable feature set, we extracted features from different partitions of the training dataset and aggregated them into feature sets for classification. We evaluated the performance of different algorithms on the basis of 10-fold cross validation and independent test dataset. 10-fold cross validation was also performed on a microarray dataset of PRCC. A random forest based feature selection (varSelRF) yielded minimum number of features (104) and a best performance with area under Precision Recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.804, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) of 0.711 and accuracy of 88{\%} with Shrunken Centroid classifier on a test dataset. We identified 80 genes that are consistently altered between stages by different feature selection algorithms. The extracted features are related to cellular components - centromere, kinetochore and spindle, and biological process mitotic cell cycle. These observations reveal potential mechanisms for an increase in chromosome instability in the late stage of PRCC. Our study demonstrates that the gene expression profiles can be used to classify stages of PRCC.},

@article{Geromanos2012,
	Abstract = {To accurately determine the quantitative change of peptides and proteins in complex proteomics samples requires knowledge of how well each ion has been measured. The precision of each ions' calculated area is predicated on how uniquely it occupies its own space in m/z and elution time. Given an initial assumption that prior to the addition of the "heavy" label, all other ion detections are unique, which is arguably untrue, an initial attempt at quantifying the pervasiveness of ion interference events in a representative binary SILAC experiment was made by comparing the centered m/z and retention time of the ion detections from the "light" variant to its "heavy" companion. Ion interference rates were determined for LC-MS data acquired at mass resolving powers of 20 and 40 K with and without ion mobility separation activated. An ion interference event was recorded, if present in the companion dataset was an ion within $\pm$ its $\Delta$ mass at half-height, $\pm$15 s of its apex retention time and if utilized by $\pm$1 drift bin. Data are presented illustrating a definitive decrease in the frequency of ion interference events with each additional increase in selectivity of the analytical workflow. Regardless of whether the quantitative experiment is a composite of labeled samples or label free, how well each ion is measured can be determined given knowledge of the instruments mass resolving power across the entire m/z scale and the ion detection algorithm reporting both the centered m/z and $\Delta$ mass at half-height for each detected ion. Given these measurements, an effective resolution can be calculated and compared with the expected instrument performance value providing a purity score for the calculated ions' area based on mass resolution. Similarly, chromatographic and drift purity scores can be calculated. In these instances, the error associated to an ions' calculated peak area is estimated by examining the variation in each measured width to that of their respective experimental median. Detail will be disclosed as to how a final ion purity score was established, providing a first measure of how accurately each ions' area was determined as well as how precise the calculated quantitative change between labeled or unlabelled pairs were determined. Presented is how common ion interference events are in quantitative proteomics LC-MS experiments and how ion purity filters can be utilized to overcome and address them, providing ultimately more accurate and precise quantification results across a wider dynamic range.},

Variable windows based on equalizing the distribution of either the precursor ion population (PIP) or the total ion current (TIC) within each window were generated by an in-house software, swathTUNER. These two variable Q1 SWATH window strategies outperformed, with respect to quantification and identification, the basic approach using a fixed window width (FIX) for proteomic profiling of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). Thus, 13.8 and 8.4{\%} additional peptide precursors, which resulted in 13.1 and 10.0{\%} more proteins, were confidently identified by SWATH using the strategy PIP and TIC, respectively, in the MDDC proteomic sample.

Targeted proteomics has emerged as a powerful approach for reproducible quantification but is limited in the number of proteins quantified. SWATH-mass spectrometry consists of data-independent acquisition and a targeted data analysis strategy that aims to maintain the favorable quantitative characteristics (accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity) of targeted proteomics at large scale. While previous SWATH-mass spectrometry studies have shown high intra-lab reproducibility, this has not been evaluated between labs. In this multi-laboratory evaluation study including 11 sites worldwide, we demonstrate that using SWATH-mass spectrometry data acquisition we can consistently detect and reproducibly quantify {\textgreater}4000 proteins from HEK293 cells. Using synthetic peptide dilution series, we show that the sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility established with SWATH-mass spectrometry are uniformly achieved. This study demonstrates that the acquisition of reproducible quantitative proteomics data by multiple labs is achievable, and broadly serves to increase confidence in SWATH-mass spectrometry data acquisition as a reproducible method for large-scale protein quantification.},

	Abstract = {To take advantage of the potential quantitative benefits offered by tandem mass spectrometry, we have modified the method in which tandem mass spectrum data are acquired in 'shotgun' proteomic analyses. The proposed method is not data dependent and is based on the sequential isolation and fragmentation of precursor windows (of 10 m/z) within the ion trap until a desired mass range has been covered. We compared the quantitative figures of merit for this method to those for existing strategies by performing an analysis of the soluble fraction of whole-cell lysates from yeast metabolically labeled in vivo with (15)N. To automate this analysis, we modified software (RelEx) previously written in the Yates lab to generate chromatograms directly from tandem mass spectra. These chromatograms showed improvements in signal-to-noise ratio of approximately three- to fivefold over corresponding chromatograms generated from mass spectrometry scans. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of the data-independent acquisition strategy coupled with chromatogram reconstruction from tandem mass spectra, we measured protein expression levels in two developmental stages of Caenorhabditis elegans.},

	Abstract = {Fourier transform-all reaction monitoring (FT-ARM) is a novel approach for the identification and quantification of peptides that relies upon the selectivity of high mass accuracy data and the specificity of peptide fragmentation patterns. An FT-ARM experiment involves continuous, data-independent, high mass accuracy MS/MS acquisition spanning a defined m/z range. Custom software was developed to search peptides against the multiplexed fragmentation spectra by comparing theoretical or empirical fragment ions against every fragmentation spectrum across the entire acquisition. A dot product score is calculated against each spectrum to generate a score chromatogram used for both identification and quantification. Chromatographic elution profile characteristics are not used to cluster precursor peptide signals to their respective fragment ions. FT-ARM identifications are demonstrated to be complementary to conventional data-dependent shotgun analysis, especially in cases where the data-dependent method fails because of fragmenting multiple overlapping precursors. The sensitivity, robustness, and specificity of FT-ARM quantification are shown to be analogous to selected reaction monitoring-based peptide quantification with the added benefit of minimal assay development. Thus, FT-ARM is demonstrated to be a novel and complementary data acquisition, identification, and quantification method for the large scale analysis of peptides.},

	Abstract = {Current methodologies for protein quantitation include 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis techniques, metabolic labeling, and stable isotope labeling methods to name only a few. The current literature illustrates both pros and cons for each of the previously mentioned methodologies. Keeping with the teachings of William of Ockham, "with all things being equal the simplest solution tends to be correct", a simple LC/MS based methodology is presented that allows relative changes in abundance of proteins in highly complex mixtures to be determined. Utilizing a reproducible chromatographic separations system along with the high mass resolution and mass accuracy of an orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer, the quantitative comparison of tens of thousands of ions emanating from identically prepared control and experimental samples can be made. Using this configuration, we can determine the change in relative abundance of a small number of ions between the two conditions solely by accurate mass and retention time. Employing standard operating procedures for both sample preparation and ESI-mass spectrometry, one typically obtains under 5 ppm mass precision and quantitative variations between 10 and 15{\%}. The principal focus of this paper will demonstrate the quantitative aspects of the methodology and continue with a discussion of the associated, complementary qualitative capabilities.},

@article{Bruderer2015,
	Abstract = {The data-independent acquisition (DIA) approach has recently been introduced as a novel mass spectrometric method that promises to combine the high content aspect of shotgun proteomics with the reproducibility and precision of selected reaction monitoring. Here, we evaluate, whether SWATH-MS type DIA effectively translates into a better protein profiling as compared with the established shotgun proteomics. We implemented a novel DIA method on the widely used Orbitrap platform and used retention-time-normalized (iRT) spectral libraries for targeted data extraction using Spectronaut. We call this combination hyper reaction monitoring (HRM). Using a controlled sample set, we show that HRM outperformed shotgun proteomics both in the number of consistently identified peptides across multiple measurements and quantification of differentially abundant proteins. The reproducibility of HRM in peptide detection was above 98{\%}, resulting in quasi complete data sets compared with 49{\%} of shotgun proteomics. Utilizing HRM, we profiled acetaminophen (APAP)(1)-treated three-dimensional human liver microtissues. An early onset of relevant proteome changes was revealed at subtoxic doses of APAP. Further, we detected and quantified for the first time human NAPQI-protein adducts that might be relevant for the toxicity of APAP. The adducts were identified on four mitochondrial oxidative stress related proteins (GATM, PARK7, PRDX6, and VDAC2) and two other proteins (ANXA2 and FTCD). Our findings imply that DIA should be the preferred method for quantitative protein profiling.},

@article{Li2013,
	Abstract = {Each year, millions of pulmonary nodules are discovered by computed tomography and subsequently biopsied. Because most of these nodules are benign, many patients undergo unnecessary and costly invasive procedures. We present a 13-protein blood-based classifier that differentiates malignant and benign nodules with high confidence, thereby providing a diagnostic tool to avoid invasive biopsy on benign nodules. Using a systems biology strategy, we identified 371 protein candidates and developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay for each. The MRM assays were applied in a three-site discovery study (n = 143) on plasma samples from patients with benign and stage IA lung cancer matched for nodule size, age, gender, and clinical site, producing a 13-protein classifier. The classifier was validated on an independent set of plasma samples (n = 104), exhibiting a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90{\%}. Validation performance on samples from a nondiscovery clinical site showed an NPV of 94{\%}, indicating the general effectiveness of the classifier. A pathway analysis demonstrated that the classifier proteins are likely modulated by a few transcription regulators (NF2L2, AHR, MYC, and FOS) that are associated with lung cancer, lung inflammation, and oxidative stress networks. The classifier score was independent of patient nodule size, smoking history, and age, which are risk factors used for clinical management of pulmonary nodules. Thus, this molecular test provides a potential complementary tool to help physicians in lung cancer diagnosis.},

Online liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution MS and MS/MS yielded 166 420 peptides with unique amino-acid sequence from HeLa cells. These peptides identified 10 255 different human proteins encoded by 9207 human genes, providing a lower limit on the proteome in this cancer cell line. Deep transcriptome sequencing revealed transcripts for nearly all detected proteins. We calculate copy numbers for the expressed proteins and show that the abundances of {\textgreater} 90{\%} of them are within a factor 60 of the median protein expression level. Comparisons of the proteome and the transcriptome, and analysis of protein complex databases and GO categories, suggest that we achieved deep coverage of the functional transcriptome and the proteome of a single cell type.},

	Abstract = {Proteomics represents a significant challenge to separation scientists because of the diversity and complexity of proteins and peptides present in biological systems. Mass spectrometry as the central enabling technology in proteomics allows detection and identification of thousands of proteins and peptides in a single experiment. Liquid chromatography is recognized as an indispensable tool in proteomics research since it provides high-speed, high-resolution and high-sensitivity separation of macromolecules. In addition, the unique features of chromatography enable the detection of low-abundance species such as post-translationally modified proteins. Components such as phosphorylated proteins are often present in complex mixtures at vanishingly small concentrations. New chromatographic methods are needed to solve these analytical challenges, which are clearly formidable, but not insurmountable. This review covers recent advances in liquid chromatography, as it has impacted the area of proteomics. The future prospects for emerging chromatographic technologies such as monolithic capillary columns, high temperature chromatography and capillary electrochromatography are discussed.},

To an extent greater than has previously been possible with the more familiar "soft" ionization methods, this technique makes the power and elegance of mass spectrometric analysis applicable to the large and fragile polar molecules that play such vital roles in biological systems. The distinguishing features of electrospray spectra for large molecules are coherent sequences of peaks whose component ions are multiply charged, the ions of each peak differing by one charge from those of adjacent neighbors in the sequence. Spectra have been obtained for biopolymers including oligonucleotides and proteins, the latter having molecular weights up to 130,000, with as yet no evidence of an upper limit.},

	Abstract = {The reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data platform provides expression data for a prespecified set of proteins, across a set of tissue or cell line samples. Being able to measure either total proteins or posttranslationally modified proteins, even ones present at lower abundances, RPPA represents an excellent way to capture the state of key signaling transduction pathways in normal or diseased cells. RPPA data can be combined with those of other molecular profiling platforms, in order to obtain a more complete molecular picture of the cell. This review offers perspective on the use of RPPA as a component of integrative molecular analysis, using recent case examples from The Cancer Genome Altas consortium, showing how RPPA may provide additional insight into cancer besides what other data platforms may provide. There also exists a clear need for effective visualization approaches to RPPA-based proteomic results; this was highlighted by the recent challenge, put forth by the HPN-DREAM consortium, to develop visualization methods for a highly complex RPPA dataset involving many cancer cell lines, stimuli, and inhibitors applied over time course. In this review, we put forth a number of general guidelines for effective visualization of complex molecular datasets, namely, showing the data, ordering data elements deliberately, enabling generalization, focusing on relevant specifics, and putting things into context. We give examples of how these principles can be utilized in visualizing the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer and in meaningfully displaying the entire HPN-DREAM RPPA dataset within a single page.},

In contrast to previous protein arrays that immobilize the probe, our reverse phase protein array immobilizes the whole repertoire of patient proteins that represent the state of individual tissue cell populations undergoing disease transitions. A high degree of sensitivity, precision and linearity was achieved, making it possible to quantify the phosphorylated status of signal proteins in human tissue cell subpopulations. Using this novel protein microarray we have longitudinally analysed the state of pro-survival checkpoint proteins at the microscopic transition stage from patient matched histologically normal prostate epithelium to prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and then to invasive prostate cancer. Cancer progression was associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt (P{\textless}0.04), suppression of apoptosis pathways (P{\textless}0.03), as well as decreased phosphorylation of ERK (P{\textless}0.01). At the transition from histologically normal epithelium to PIN we observed a statistically significant surge in phosphorylated Akt (P{\textless}0.03) and a concomitant suppression of downstream apoptosis pathways which proceeds the transition into invasive carcinoma.},

This review article will outline the challenges, which must be ameliorated prior to the widespread integration of multiplex immunoassays in clinical settings: (i) biomarker validation; (ii) standardisation of immunoassay design and quality control (calibration and quantification); (iii) availability, stability, specificity and cross-reactivity of reagents; (iv) assay automation and the use of validated algorithms for transformation of raw data into diagnostic results. A compendium of multiplex immunoassays applicable to in vitro diagnostics and a summary of the diagnostic products currently available commercially are included, along with an analysis of the relative states of development for each format (namely planar slide based, suspension and planar/microtitre plate based) with respect to the aforementioned issues.},

@article{Ortea2018,
	Abstract = {A typical clinical manifestation of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a short stature resulting from delayed growth, but GHD affects bone health, cardiovascular function and metabolic profile and therefore quality of life. Although early GH treatment during childhood has been shown to improve outcomes, no single biochemical parameter is currently available for the accurate diagnosis of GHD in children. There is hence a need for non-invasive biomarkers. In this study, the relative abundance of serum proteins from GHD children and healthy controls was measured by next-generation proteomics SWATH-MS technology. The data generated was analysed by machine-learning feature-selection algorithms in order to discover the minimum number of protein biomarkers that best discriminate between both groups. The analysis of serum proteins by a SWATH-MS approach yielded a useful method for discovering potential biomarkers of GHD in children. A total of 263 proteins were confidently detected and quantified in each sample. Pathway analysis indicated an effect on tissue/organ structure and morphogenesis. The top ten serum protein biomarker candidates were identified after applying feature-selection data analysis. The combination of three proteins -- apolipoprotein A-IV, complement factor H-related protein 4 and platelet basic protein -- demonstrated the best classification performance for our data. In addition, the apolipoprotein group resulted in strong over-representation, thus highlighting these proteins as an additional promising biomarker panel. 

SIGNIFICANCE
Currently there is no single biochemical parameter available for the accurate diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) in children. Simple GH measurements are not an option: because GH is released in a pulsatile action, its blood levels fluctuate throughout the day and remain nearly undetectable for most of that time. This makes measurements of GH in a single blood sample useless for assessing GH deficiency. Actually, the diagnosis of GHD includes a combination of direct and indirect non-accurate measurements, such as taking several body measurements, testing GH levels in multiple blood samples after provocative tests (GH peak {\textless}7.3ng/mL, using radioimmunoassay), and conducting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), among others. Therefore, there is a need for simple, non-invasive, accurate and cost-effective biomarkers. Here we report a case-control study, where relative abundance of serum proteins were measured by next-generation proteomics SWATH-MS technology in 15 GHD children and 15healthy controls matched by age, sex, and not receiving any treatment. Data generated was analysed by machine learning feature selection algorithms. 263 proteins could be confidently detected and quantified on each sample. The top 10 serum protein biomarker candidates could be identified after applying a feature selection data analysis. The combination of three proteins, apolipoprotein A-IV, complement factor H-related protein 4 and platelet basic protein, showed the best classification performance for our data. In addition, the fact that the pathway and GO analysis we performed pointed to the apolipoproteins as over-represented highlights this protein group as an additional promising biomarker panel for the diagnosis of GHD and for treatment evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Background The likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with breast cancer who have no involved lymph nodes and estrogen-receptor--positive tumors is poorly defined by clinical and histopathological measures. Methods We tested whether the results of a reverse-transcriptase--polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 21 prospectively selected genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue would correlate with the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with node-negative, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer who were enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trial B-14. The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient. Results Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were...},

@article{Mehta2010,
	Abstract = {Over the last 10 years there has been an explosion of information about the molecular biology of cancer. A challenge in oncology is to translate this information into advances in patient care. While there are well-formed routes for translating new molecular information into drug therapy, the routes for translating new information into sensitive and specific diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests are still being developed. Similarly, the science of using tumor molecular profiles to select clinical trial participants or to optimize therapy for individual patients is still in its infancy. This review will summarize the current technologies for predicting treatment response and prognosis in cancer medicine, and outline what the future may hold. It will also highlight the potential importance of methods that can integrate molecular, histopathological and clinical information into a synergistic understanding of tumor progression. While these possibilities are without doubt exciting, significant challenges remain if we are to implement them with a strong evidence base in a widely available and cost-effective manner.},

@article{McShane2005,
	Abstract = {Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumour markers in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully small. Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons that multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodologic problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumour marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalisability of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumour marker studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomised trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, pre-planned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines suggest helpful presentations of data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply. {\textcopyright} 2005 Douglas G.

	Abstract = {During the last 15 years, traditional breast cancer classifications based on histopathology have been reorganized into the luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and basal-like subtypes based on gene expression profiling. Each molecular subtype has shown varying risk for progression, response to treatment, and survival outcomes. Research linking the imaging phenotype with the molecular subtype has revealed that non-calcified, relatively circumscribed masses with posterior acoustic enhancement are common in the basal-like subtype, spiculated masses with a poorly circumscribed margin and posterior acoustic shadowing in the luminal subtype, and pleomorphic calcifications in the HER2-enriched subtype. Understanding the clinical implications of the molecular subtypes and imaging phenotypes could help radiologists guide precision medicine, tailoring medical treatment to patients and their tumor characteristics.},

	Abstract = {Clinical analysis of blood is the most widespread diagnostic procedure in medicine, and blood biomarkers are used to categorize patients and to support treatment decisions. However, existing biomarkers are far from comprehensive and often lack specificity and new ones are being developed at a very slow rate. As described in this review, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful technology in biological research and it is now poised to allow the characterization of the plasma proteome in great depth. Previous "triangular strategies" aimed at discovering single biomarker candidates in small cohorts, followed by classical immunoassays in much larger validation cohorts. We propose a "rectangular" plasma proteome profiling strategy, in which the proteome patterns of large cohorts are correlated with their phenotypes in health and disease. Translating such concepts into clinical practice will require restructuring several aspects of diagnostic decision-making, and we discuss some first steps in this direction.},

Previous work focused mainly on the development of methods for effective batch effects removal. However, their impact on cross-batch prediction performance, which is one of the most important goals in microarray-based applications, has not been addressed. This paper uses a broad selection of data sets from the Microarray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) effort, generated on three microarray platforms with different causes of batch effects to assess the efficacy of their removal. Two data sets from cross-tissue and cross-platform experiments are also included. Of the 120 cases studied using Support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbors (KNN) as classifiers and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as performance metric, we find that Ratio-G, Ratio-A, EJLR, mean-centering and standardization methods perform better or equivalent to no batch effect removal in 89, 85, 83, 79 and 75{\%} of the cases, respectively, suggesting that the application of these methods is generally advisable and ratio-based methods are preferred.},

The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.},

@article{Determan2015,
	Abstract = {Metabolomics, the systematic identification and quantification of all metabolites in a biological system, is increasingly applied towards identification of biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis and risk prediction. Applications of metabolomics extend across the health spectrum including Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, and trauma. Despite the continued interest in metabolomics there are numerous techniques for analyzing metabolomics datasets with the intent to classify group membership (e.g. Control or Treated). These include Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Regularized Generalized Linear Models, and Prediction Analysis for Microarrays. Each classification algorithm is dependent upon different assumptions and can potentially lead to alternate conclusions. This project seeks to conduct an in depth comparison of algorithm performance on both simulated and real datasets to determine which algorithms perform best given alternate dataset structures. Three simulated datasets were generated to validate algorithm performance and mimic 'real' metabolomics data: (Han et al., 2011) independent null dataset (no correlation, no discriminatory variables), (Davis, Schiller, Eurich, {\&} Sawyer, 2012) correlated null (no discriminating variables), (Guan et al., 2009) correlated discriminatory. This comparison is also applied to 3 open-access datasets including two Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and one Mass Spectrometry (MS) dataset. Performance was evaluated based on the Robustness-Performance-Trade-off (RPT) incorporating a balance between model classification accuracy and feature selection stability. We also provide a free, open-source R Bioconductor package (OmicsMarkeR) that conducts the analyses herein. The proposed work provides an important advancement in metabolomics analysis and helps alleviate the confusion of potentially paradoxical analyses thereby leading to improved exploration of disease states and identification of clinically important biomarkers.},

	Abstract = {Summary Batch effects are present in microarray experiments due to poor experimental design and when data are combined from different studies. To assess the quantity of batch effects, we present a novel hybrid approach known as principal variance component analysis (PVCA). The approach leverages the strengths of two popular data analysis methods: principal component analysis and variance components analysis, and integrates into a novel algorithm. It can be used as a screening tool to determine the sources of variability, and, using the eigenvalues associated with their corresponding eigenvectors as weights, to quantify the magnitude of each source of variability (including each batch effect) presented as a proportion of total variance. Although PVCA is a generic approach for quantifying the corresponding proportion of variation of each effect, it can be a handy assessment for estimating batch effect before and after batch normalization.},

Methods Using microarray analysis to evaluate our previously established 70-gene prognosis profile, we classified a series of 295 consecutive patients with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis. All patients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than 53 years old; 151 had lymph-node--negative disease, and 144 had lymph-node--positive disease. We evaluated the predictive power of the prognosis profile using univariable and multivariable statistical analyses.

@article{Bland2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges in biology is the correct identification of promoter regions. Computational methods based on motif searching have been the traditional approach taken. Recent studies have shown that DNA structural properties, such as curvature, stacking energy, and stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD) are useful in promoter prediction, as well. In this paper, the currently used SIDD energy threshold method is compared to the proposed artificial neural network (ANN) approach for finding promoters based on SIDD profile data.

RESULTS: When compared to the SIDD threshold prediction method, artificial neural networks showed noticeable improvements for precision, recall, and F-score over a range of values. The maximal F-score for the ANN classifier was 62.3 and 56.8 for the threshold-based classifier.

CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks were used to predict promoters based on SIDD profile data. Results using this technique were an improvement over the previous SIDD threshold approach. Over a wide range of precision-recall values, artificial neural networks were more capable of identifying distinctive characteristics of promoter regions than threshold based methods.},

	Abstract = {Mass-spectrometry-based methods for relative proteome quantification have broadly affected life science research. However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative data--that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73{\%}) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83{\%} of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology.},

	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we de-scribe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	Abstract = {Molybdenum-independent nitrogenases were first described in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii and have since been described in other diazotrophic bacteria. Previously, we reported the isolation of seven diazotrophs with Mo-independent nitrogenases from aquatic environments. In the present study, we extend these results to include diazotrophs isolated from wood chip mulch, soil, "paraffin dirt," and sediments from mangrove swamps. Mo-deficient, N-free media under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions were used for the isolations. A total of 26 isolates were genetically and physiologically characterized. Their phylogenetic placement was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Most of the isolates are members of the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria and appear to be specifically related to fluorescent pseudomonads and azotobacteria. Two other isolates, AN1 and LPF4, are closely related to Enterobacter spp. and Paenibacillus spp., respectively. PCR and/or Southern hybridization were used to detect the presence of nitrogenase genes in the isolates. PCR amplification of vnfG and anfG was used to detect the genetic potential for the expression of the vanadium-containing nitrogenase and the iron-only nitrogenase in the isolates. This study demonstrates that diazotrophs with Mo-independent nitrogenases can be readily isolated from diverse natural environments.},

	Abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is catalysed by some photosynthetic bacteria. This paper presents a phylogenetic comparison of a nitrogen fixation gene (nifH) with the aim of elucidating the processes underlying the evolutionary history of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In the NifH phylogeny, strains of Rps. palustris were placed in close association with Rhodobacter spp. and other phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria belonging to the alpha-Proteobacteria, separated from its close relatives Bradyrhizobium japonicum and the phototrophic rhizobia (Bradyrhizobium spp. IRBG 2, IRBG 228, IRBG 230 and BTAi 1) as deduced from the 16S rRNA phylogeny. The close association of the strains of Rps. palustris with those of Rhodobacter and Rhodovulum, as well as Rhodospirillum rubrum, was supported by the mol{\%} G+C of their nifH gene and by the signature sequences found in the sequence alignment. In contrast, comparison of a number of informational and operational genes common to Rps. palustris CGA009, B. japonicum USDA 110 and Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 suggested that the genome of Rps. palustris is more related to that of B. japonicum than to the Rba. sphaeroides genome. These results strongly suggest that the nifH of Rps. palustris is highly related to those of the phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria included in this study, and might have come from an ancestral gene common to these phototrophic species through lateral gene transfer. Although this finding complicates the use of nifH to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the phototrophic bacteria in molecular diversity studies, it establishes a framework to resolve the origins and diversification of nitrogen fixation among the phototrophic bacteria in the alpha-Proteobacteria.},

	Abstract = {Extensive genomic characterization of human cancers presents the problem of inference from genomic abnormalities to cancer phenotypes. To address this problem, we analysed proteomes of colon and rectal tumours characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and perform integrated proteogenomic analyses. Somatic variants displayed reduced protein abundance compared to germline variants. Messenger RNA transcript abundance did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumours. Proteomics identified five proteomic subtypes in the TCGA cohort, two of which overlapped with the TCGA 'microsatellite instability/CpG island methylation phenotype' transcriptomic subtype, but had distinct mutation, methylation and protein expression patterns associated with different clinical outcomes. Although copy number alterations showed strong cis- and trans-effects on mRNA abundance, relatively few of these extend to the protein level. Thus, proteomics data enabled prioritization of candidate driver genes. The chromosome 20q amplicon was associated with the largest global changes at both mRNA and protein levels; proteomics data highlighted potential 20q candidates, including HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha), TOMM34 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase). Integrated proteogenomic analysis provides functional context to interpret genomic abnormalities and affords a new paradigm for understanding cancer biology.},

In contrast, several lines of rather indirect in vitro evidence suggest that 70S monosomes are capable of initiating translation of leaderless mRNAs, starting with the A of the initiation codon. In this study, we demonstrate the proficiency of dedicated 70S ribosomes in in vitro translation of leaderless mRNAs. In support, we show that a natural leaderless mRNA can be translated with crosslinked 70S wild-type ribosomes. Moreover, we report that leaderless mRNA translation continues under conditions where the prevalence of 70S ribosomes is created in vivo, and where translation of bulk mRNA ceases. These studies provide in vivo as well as direct in vitro evidence for a 70S initiation pathway of a naturally occurring leaderless mRNA, and are discussed in light of their significance for bacterial growth under adverse conditions and their evolutionary implications for translation.},

	Abstract = {Survivin (BIRC5) relationship with tumor is presented in several papers. However, how the molecular network and interpretation concerning BIRC5 cell cycle between no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated. Here, we constructed and analyzed significant higher expression gene BIRC5 activated and inhibited cell cycle network from HCC versus no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis patients (viral infection HCV or HBV) in GEO Dataset by combination of gene regulatory network inference method based on linear programming and decomposition procedure with the CapitalBio MAS 3.0 software based on the integration of public databases including Gene Ontology, KEGG, BioCarta, GenMapp, Intact, UniGene, OMIM, etc. Compared the same and different activated and inhibited BIRC5 network with GO analysis between no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis and HCC, our result showed BIRC5 cell cycle network weaker transcription factor activity in both no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis and HCC (1); stronger nucleus protein binding but weaker cytoplasm protein binding in no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis (2); stronger cytoplasm protein phosphatase binding but weaker ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in HCC (3). Therefore, we inferred BIRC5 cell cycle module less transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in both no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis and HCC (4). We deduced BIRC5 cell cycle module different from more mitosis but less complex-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism as a result increasing cell division and cell numbers in no-tumor hepatitis/cirrhosis to more protein amino acid autophosphorylation but less negative regulation of ubiquitin ligase activity during mitotic cell cycle as a result increasing growth and cell volume in HCC (5).},

	Abstract = {We present a computational pipeline for the quantification of peptides and proteins in label-free LC-MS/MS data sets. The pipeline is composed of tools from the OpenMS software framework and is applicable to the processing of large experiments (50+ samples). We describe several enhancements that we have introduced to OpenMS to realize the implementation of this pipeline. They include new algorithms for centroiding of raw data, for feature detection, for the alignment of multiple related measurements, and a new tool for the calculation of peptide and protein abundances. Where possible, we compare the performance of the new algorithms to that of their established counterparts in OpenMS. We validate the pipeline on the basis of two small data sets that provide ground truths for the quantification. There, we also compare our results to those of MaxQuant and Progenesis LC-MS, two popular alternatives for the analysis of label-free data. We then show how our software can be applied to a large heterogeneous data set of 58 LC-MS/MS runs.},

	Abstract = {The crystal structure of the initiating form of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase, containing core RNA polymerase (alpha2betabeta'omega) and the promoter specificity sigma subunit, has been determined at 4 angstrom resolution. Important structural features of the RNA polymerase and their roles in positioning sigma within the initiation complex are delineated, as well as the role played by sigma in modulating the opening of the RNA polymerase active-site channel. The two carboxyl-terminal domains of sigma are separated by 45 angstroms on the surface of the RNA polymerase, but are linked by an extended loop. The loop winds near the RNA polymerase active site, where it may play a role in initiating nucleotide substrate binding, and out through the RNA exit channel. The advancing RNA transcript must displace the loop, leading to abortive initiation and ultimately to sigma release.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess the effect of additional extreme apical sampling on prostate cancer (PCa) detection and aggressiveness in patients with standard risk versus high risk of a positive biopsy.

METHODS: Three thousand fifty three men were reviewed from our institution review board approved prostate biopsy database. Two thousand five hundred and twenty one underwent biopsy with 12 cores while 532 underwent 14 core sampling (2 extra cores from the extreme anterior apex). Patients were stratified into one of two risk groups: (1) standard risk of PCa (elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) {\textless} 10 ng/ml, normal digital rectal exam (DRE), and no lesions on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)), and (2) higher risk of PCa (PSA {\textgreater} 10 ng/ml and/or abnormal DRE and/or lesion on TRUS). Prostate cancer detection and disease characteristics were compared between the biopsy schemes stratified by risk of a positive biopsy.

RESULTS: PCa detection with 14 core sampling was more likely in all patients (OR 1.339, 95{\%} CL 1.070-1.676) and in men with standard risk (OR 1.334, 95{\%} CL 1.007-1.769). A greater median number of positive cores (3 vs. 2) and a higher maximum cancer {\%} per core (40{\%} vs. 25{\%}) were seen in the 14 core cohort when stratified to standard risk. Gleason ≥7 was more likely detected with 14 cores in the standard risk group (55.6{\%} vs. 45.2{\%}). Differences in PCa detection and Gleason ≥7 between biopsy techniques were not noted in the higher risk group.

CONCLUSION: Extreme apical sampling increases aggressive cancer detection on initial biopsy, especially in patients with standard risk of PCa.},

	Abstract = {The post-genomic era promises to pave the way to a personalized understanding of disease processes, with technological and analytical advances helping to solve some of the world's health challenges. Despite extraordinary progress in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis, the disease remains one of the world's major medical problems. New therapies and diagnostic procedures to guide their clinical application are urgently required. OncoTrack, a consortium between industry and academia, supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, signifies a new era in personalized medicine, which synthesizes current technological advances in omics techniques, systems biology approaches, and mathematical modeling. A truly personalized molecular imprint of the tumor micro-environment and subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic insight is gained, with the ultimate goal of matching the "right" patient to the "right" drug and identifying predictive biomarkers for clinical application. This comprehensive mapping of the colon cancer molecular landscape in tandem with crucial, clinical functional annotation for systems biology analysis provides unprecedented insight and predictive power for colon cancer management. Overall, we show that major biotechnological developments in tandem with changes in clinical thinking have laid the foundations for the OncoTrack approach and the future clinical application of a truly personalized approach to colon cancer theranostics.},

@article{Choudhary2006,
	Abstract = {Three strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides of diverse origin have been under investigation in our laboratory for their genome complexities, including the presence of multiple chromosomes and the distribution of essential genes within their genomes. The genome of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 has been completely sequenced and fully annotated, and now two additional strains (ATCC 17019 and ATCC 17025) of R. sphaeroides have been sequenced. Thus, genome comparisons have become a useful approach in determining the evolutionary relationships among different strains of R. sphaeroides. In this study, the concatenated chromosomal sequences from the three strains of R. sphaeroides were aligned, using Mauve, to examine the extent of shared DNA regions and the degree of relatedness among their chromosome-specific DNA sequences. In addition, the exact intra- and interchromosomal DNA duplications were analyzed using Mummer. Genome analyses employing these two independent approaches revealed that strain ATCC 17025 diverged considerably from the other two strains, 2.4.1 and ATCC 17029, and that the two latter strains are more closely related to one another. Results further demonstrated that chromosome II (CII)-specific DNA sequences of R. sphaeroides have rapidly evolved, while CI-specific DNA sequences have remained highly conserved. Aside from the size variation of CII of R. sphaeroides, variation in sequence lengths of the CII-shared DNA regions and their high sequence divergence among strains of R. sphaeroides suggest the involvement of CII in the evolution of strain-specific genomic rearrangements, perhaps requiring strains to adapt in specialized niches.},

@article{Singh:2011aa,
	Abstract = {In bacteria, promoter identification by RNA polymerase is mediated by a dissociable $\sigma$ factor. The housekeeping $\sigma$(70) factor of Escherichia coli recognizes two well characterized DNA sequence elements, known as the '-10' and '-35' hexamers. These elements are separated by 'spacer' DNA, the sequence of which is generally considered unimportant. Here, we use a combination of bioinformatics, genetics and biochemistry to show that $\sigma$(70) can sense the sequence and conformation of the promoter spacer region. Our data illustrate how alterations in spacer region sequence can increase promoter activity. This stimulatory effect requires $\sigma$(70) side chain R451, which is located in close proximity to the non-template strand at promoter position -18. Conversely, R451 is not required to mediate transcriptional stimulation by improvement of the -10 element. Mutation of $\sigma$(70) residue R451, which is highly conserved, results in reduced growth rate, consistent with a central role in promoter recognition.},

@article{Yuvaniyama2000a,
	Abstract = {The NifS and NifU proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii are required for the full activation of nitrogenase. NifS is a homodimeric cysteine desulfurase that supplies the inorganic sulfide necessary for formation of the Fe-S clusters contained within the nitrogenase component proteins. NifU has been suggested to complement NifS either by mobilizing the Fe necessary for nitrogenase Fe-S cluster formation or by providing an intermediate Fe-S cluster assembly site. As isolated, the homodimeric NifU protein contains one [2Fe-2S](2+, +) cluster per subunit, which is referred to as the permanent cluster. In this report, we show that NifU is able to interact with NifS and that a second, transient [2Fe-2S] cluster can be assembled within NifU in vitro when incubated in the presence of ferric ion, L-cysteine, and catalytic amounts of NifS. Approximately one transient [2Fe-2S] cluster is assembled per homodimer. The transient [2Fe-2S] cluster species is labile and rapidly released on reduction. We propose that transient [2Fe-2S] cluster units are formed on NifU and then released to supply the inorganic iron and sulfur necessary for maturation of the nitrogenase component proteins. The role of the permanent [2Fe-2S] clusters contained within NifU is not yet known, but they could have a redox function involving either the formation or release of transient [2Fe-2S] cluster units assembled on NifU. Because homologs to both NifU and NifS, respectively designated IscU and IscS, are found in non-nitrogen fixing organisms, it is possible that the function of NifU proposed here could represent a general mechanism for the maturation of Fe-S cluster-containing proteins.},

	Abstract = {We present here a new approach to the problem of defining RNA signatures and finding their occurrences in sequence databases. The proposed method is based on "secondary structure profiles". An RNA sequence alignment with secondary structure information is used as an input. Two types of weight matrices/profiles are constructed from this alignment: single strands are represented by a classical lod-scores profile while helical regions are represented by an extended "helical profile" comprising 16 lod-scores per position, one for each of the 16 possible base-pairs. Database searches are then conducted using a simultaneous search for helical profiles and dynamic programming alignment of single strand profiles. The algorithm has been implemented into a new software, ERPIN, that performs both profile construction and database search. Applications are presented for several RNA motifs. The automated use of sequence information in both single-stranded and helical regions yields better sensitivity/specificity ratios than descriptor-based programs. Furthermore, since the translation of alignments into profiles is straightforward with ERPIN, iterative searches can easily be conducted to enrich collections of homologous RNAs.},

	Abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA6T was determined. The genome of USDA6T is a single circular chromosome of 9,207,384 bp. The genome size is similar to that of the genome of another soybean symbiont, B. japonicum USDA110 (9,105,828 bp). Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of USDA6T and USDA110 showed colinearity of major regions in the two genomes, although a large inversion exists between them. A significantly high level of sequence conservation was detected in three regions on each genome. The gene constitution and nucleotide sequence features in these three regions indicate that they may have been derived from a symbiosis island. An ancestral, large symbiosis island, approximately 860 kb in total size, appears to have been split into these three regions by unknown large-scale genome rearrangements. The two integration events responsible for this appear to have taken place independently, but through comparable mechanisms, in both genomes.},

	Abstract = {The development of drugs to prevent prostate cancer is underway, yet monitoring the potential efficacy of these agents during clinical trials relies on measuring intermediate endpoints. In this review, various candidate markers are presented that are under different stages of evaluation as intermediate endpoint biomarkers. In addition, the near future will bring an unprecedented wave of new potential biomarkers. For instance, through genomics-based methods many new genes are being discovered whose altered expression may be involved in different phases of prostate cancer development and progression. In the development of rational approaches for selecting which of these untested biomarkers may be useful to measure systematically, there must be an improved understanding of the mechanisms of prostatic carcinogenesis. We submit that this improved understanding will come through new knowledge of the biology of normal prostate epithelial cells, the determination of the precise target cells of transformation, and how their growth regulation is genetically and epigenetically perturbed during the phases of initiation and progression. In this review, therefore, we also present our recent immune-mediated oxidant injury and regeneration hypothesis of why and how the prostate is targeted for carcinogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2001, Elsevier Science Inc.},

Previously no consensus picture emerged concerning the nature of FixJ binding sites. Here we used in vitro DNA selection in order to systematically characterise FixJ binding sequences. This led to the definition of two classes of sites. Class I sites share the CTAAG- TAGTTTCCC sequence found in the fixK promoter, whereas class II sites are defined by a GTAMGTAG consensus octamer.

	Abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	Abstract = {Iron-sulfur clusters [Fe-S] are small, ubiquitous inorganic cofactors representing one of the earliest catalysts during biomolecule evolution and are involved in fundamental biological reactions, including regulation of enzyme activity, mitochondrial respiration, ribosome biogenesis, cofactor biogenesis, gene expression regulation, and nucleotide metabolism. Although simple in structure, [Fe-S] biogenesis requires complex protein machineries and pathways for assembly. [Fe-S] are assembled from cysteine-derived sulfur and iron onto scaffold proteins followed by transfer to recipient apoproteins. Several predominant iron-sulfur biogenesis systems have been identified, including nitrogen fixation (NIF), sulfur utilization factor (SUF), iron-sulfur cluster (ISC), and cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA), and many protein components have been identified and characterized. In eukaryotes ISC is mainly localized to mitochondria, cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly to the cytosol, whereas plant sulfur utilization factor is localized mainly to plastids. Because of this spatial separation, evidence suggests cross-talk mediated by organelle export machineries and dual targeting mechanisms. Although research efforts in understanding iron-sulfur biogenesis has been centered on bacteria, yeast, and plants, recent efforts have implicated inappropriate [Fe-S] biogenesis to underlie many human diseases. In this review we detail our current understanding of [Fe-S] biogenesis across species boundaries highlighting evolutionary conservation and divergence and assembling our knowledge into a cellular context.},

	Abstract = {Determining the full complement of protein-coding genes is a key goal of genome annotation. The most powerful approach for confirming protein-coding potential is the detection of cellular protein expression through peptide mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. Here, we mapped peptides detected in seven large-scale proteomics studies to almost 60{\%} of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE annotation of the human genome. We found a strong relationship between detection in proteomics experiments and both gene family age and cross-species conservation. Most of the genes for which we detected peptides were highly conserved. We found peptides for {\textgreater}96{\%} of genes that evolved before bilateria. At the opposite end of the scale, we identified almost no peptides for genes that have appeared since primates, for genes that did not have any protein-like features or for genes with poor cross-species conservation. These results motivated us to describe a set of 2001 potential non-coding genes based on features such as weak conservation, a lack of protein features, or ambiguous annotations from major databases, all of which correlated with low peptide detection across the seven experiments. We identified peptides for just 3{\%} of these genes. We show that many of these genes behave more like non-coding genes than protein-coding genes and suggest that most are unlikely to code for proteins under normal circumstances. We believe that their inclusion in the human protein-coding gene catalogue should be revised as part of the ongoing human genome annotation effort. },

@article{Hijum:2009aa,
	Abstract = {A major part of organismal complexity and versatility of prokaryotes resides in their ability to fine-tune gene expression to adequately respond to internal and external stimuli. Evolution has been very innovative in creating intricate mechanisms by which different regulatory signals operate and interact at promoters to drive gene expression. The regulation of target gene expression by transcription factors (TFs) is governed by control logic brought about by the interaction of regulators with TF binding sites (TFBSs) in cis-regulatory regions. A factor that in large part determines the strength of the response of a target to a given TF is motif stringency, the extent to which the TFBS fits the optimal TFBS sequence for a given TF. Advances in high-throughput technologies and computational genomics allow reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in silico. To optimize the prediction of transcriptional regulatory networks, i.e., to separate direct regulation from indirect regulation, a thorough understanding of the control logic underlying the regulation of gene expression is required. This review summarizes the state of the art of the elements that determine the functionality of TFBSs by focusing on the molecular biological mechanisms and evolutionary origins of cis-regulatory regions.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the similarity of spectra is an important task in various areas of spectroscopy, e.g. to identify a compound by comparing sample spectra to those of reference standards. In mass spectrometry based discovery proteomics, spectral comparisons are used to infer the amino acid sequence of peptides. In targeted proteomics by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or SWATH MS, predetermined sets of fragment ion signals integrated over chromatographic time are used to identify target peptides in complex samples. In both cases, confidence in peptide identification is directly related to the quality of spectral matches. In this study, we used sets of simulated spectra of well-controlled dissimilarity to benchmark different spectral comparison measures and to develop a robust scoring scheme that quantifies the similarity of fragment ion spectra. We applied the normalized contrast spectral angle score to quantify the similarity of spectra to objectively assess fragment ion variability of tandem mass spectrometric datasets, to evaluate portability of peptide fragment ion spectra for targeted mass spectrometry across different types of mass spectrometers and to discriminate target assays from decoys in targeted proteomics. Altogether, this study validates the use of the normalized spectral contrast angle as a sensitive spectral similarity measure for targeted proteomics, and more generally provides a methodology to assess the performance of spectral comparisons and to support the rational selection of the most appropriate similarity measure. The algorithms used in this study are made publicly available as an open source toolset with a graphical user interface.},

@article{Mitarai2008,
	Abstract = {Noise in the expression of a gene produces fluctuations in the concentration of the gene product. These fluctuations can interfere with optimal function or can be exploited to generate beneficial diversity between cells; gene expression noise is therefore expected to be subject to evolutionary pressure. Shifts between modes of high and low rates of transcription initiation at a promoter appear to contribute to this noise both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, models invoked for eukaryotic promoter noise such as stable activation scaffolds or persistent nucleosome alterations seem unlikely to apply to prokaryotic promoters. We consider the relative importance of the steps required for transcription initiation. The 3-step transcription initiation model of McClure is extended into a mathematical model that can be used to predict consequences of additional promoter properties. We show in principle that the transcriptional bursting observed at an E. coli promoter by Golding et al. (2005) can be explained by stimulation of initiation by the negative supercoiling behind a transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) or by the formation of moribund or dead-end RNAP-promoter complexes. Both mechanisms are tunable by the alteration of promoter kinetics and therefore allow the optimization of promoter mediated noise.},

	Abstract = {Multidrug efflux systems not only cause resistance against antibiotics and toxic compounds but also mediate successful host colonization by certain plant-associated bacteria. The genome of the nitrogen-fixing soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum encodes 24 members of the family of resistance/nodulation/cell division (RND) multidrug efflux systems, of which BdeAB is genetically controlled by the RegSR two-component regulatory system. Phylogenetic analysis of the membrane components of these 24 RND-type transporters revealed that BdeB is more closely related to functionally characterized orthologs in other bacteria, including those associated with plants, than to any of the other 23 paralogs in B. japonicum. A mutant with a deletion of the bdeAB genes was more susceptible to inhibition by the aminoglycosides kanamycin and gentamicin than the wild type, and had a strongly decreased symbiotic nitrogen-fixation activity on soybean, but not on the alternative host plants mungbean and cowpea, and only very marginally on siratro. The host-specific role of a multidrug efflux pump is a novel feature in the rhizobia-legume symbioses. Consistent with the RegSR dependency of bdeAB, a B. japonicum regR mutant was found to have a greater sensitivity against the two tested antibiotics and a symbiotic defect that is most pronounced for soybean.},

	Abstract = {Bacteria have evolved a wide variety of metabolic strategies to cope with varied environments. Some are specialists and only able to survive in restricted environments; others are generalists and able to cope with diverse environmental conditions. Rhizobia (e.g. Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Azorhizobium species) can survive and compete for nutrients in soil and the plant rhizosphere but can also form a beneficial symbiosis with legumes in a highly specialized plant cell environment. Inside the legume-root nodule, the bacteria (bacteroids) reduce dinitrogen to ammonium, which is secreted to the plant in exchange for a carbon and energy source. A new and challenging aspect of nodule physiology is that nitrogen fixation requires the cycling of amino acids between the bacteroid and plant. This review aims to summarize the metabolic plasticity of rhizobia and the importance of amino acid cycling.},

	Abstract = {The proposed model is based on the measurement of the retention times of 346 tryptic peptides in the 560- to 4,000-Da mass range, derived from a mixture of 17 protein digests. These peptides were measured in HPLC-MALDI MS runs, with peptide identities confirmed by MS/MS. The model relies on summation of the retention coefficients of the individual amino acids, as in previous approaches, but additional terms are introduced that depend on the retention coefficients for amino acids at the N-terminal of the peptide. In the 17-protein mixture, optimization of two sets of coefficients, along with additional compensation for peptide length and hydrophobicity, yielded a linear dependence of retention time on hydrophobicity, with an R2 value about 0.94. The predictive capability of the model was used to distinguish peptides with close m/z values and for detailed peptide mapping of selected proteins. Its applicability was tested on columns of different sizes, from nano- to narrow-bore, and for direct sample injection, or injection via a pre-column. It can be used for accurate prediction of retention times for tryptic peptides on reversed-phase (300-A pore size) columns of different sizes with a linear water-ACN gradient and with TFA as the ion-pairing modifier.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Small open reading frames (sORFs) and genes for non-coding RNAs are poorly investigated components of most genomes. Our analysis of 1391 ORFs recently annotated in the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 revealed that 78{\%} of them contain less than 80 codons. Twenty-one of these sORFs are conserved in or outside Alphaproteobacteria and most of them are similar to genes found in transposable elements, in line with their broad distribution. Stabilizing selection was demonstrated for sORFs with proteomic evidence and bll1319-ISGA which is conserved at the nucleotide level in 16 alphaproteobacterial species, 79 species from other taxa and 49 other Proteobacteria. Further we used Northern blot hybridization to validate ten small RNAs (BjsR1 to BjsR10) belonging to new RNA families. We found that BjsR1 and BjsR3 have homologs outside the genus Bradyrhizobium, and BjsR5, BjsR6, BjsR7, and BjsR10 have up to four imperfect copies in Bradyrhizobium genomes. BjsR8, BjsR9, and BjsR10 are present exclusively in nodules, while the other sRNAs are also expressed in liquid cultures. We also found that the level of BjsR4 decreases after exposure to tellurite and iron, and this down-regulation contributes to survival under high iron conditions. Analysis of additional small RNAs overlapping with 3′-UTRs revealed two new repetitive elements named Br-REP1 and Br-REP2. These REP elements may play roles in the genomic plasticity and gene regulation and could be useful for strain identification by PCR-fingerprinting. Furthermore, we studied two potential toxin genes in the symbiotic island and confirmed toxicity of the yhaV homolog bll1687 but not of the newly annotated higB homolog blr0229-ISGA in E. coli. Finally, we revealed transcription interference resulting in an antisense RNA complementary to blr1853, a gene induced in symbiosis. The presented results expand our knowledge on sORFs, non-coding RNAs and repetitive elements in B. japonicum and related bacteria.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given an observed test statistic and its degrees of freedom, one may compute the observed P value with most statistical packages. It is unknown to what extent test statistics and P values are congruent in published medical papers. METHODS: We checked the congruence of statistical results reported in all the papers of volumes 409-412 of Nature (2001) and a random sample of 63 results from volumes 322-323 of BMJ (2001). We also tested whether the frequencies of the last digit of a sample of 610 test statistics deviated from a uniform distribution (i.e., equally probable digits). RESULTS: 11.6{\%} (21 of 181) and 11.1{\%} (7 of 63) of the statistical results published in Nature and BMJ respectively during 2001 were incongruent, probably mostly due to rounding, transcription, or type-setting errors. At least one such error appeared in 38{\%} and 25{\%} of the papers of Nature and BMJ, respectively. In 12{\%} of the cases, the significance level might change one or more orders of magnitude. The frequencies of the last digit of statistics deviated from the uniform distribution and suggested digit preference in rounding and reporting. CONCLUSIONS: This incongruence of test statistics and P values is another example that statistical practice is generally poor, even in the most renowned scientific journals, and that quality of papers should be more controlled and valued.},

@article{Li:2014ab,
	Abstract = {Labor intensive experiments are typically required to identify the causal disease variants from a list of disease associated variants in the genome. For designing such experiments, candidate variants are ranked by their strength of genetic association with the disease. However, the two commonly used measures of genetic association, the odds-ratio (OR) and p-value may rank variants in different order. To integrate these two measures into a single analysis, here we transfer the volcano plot methodology from gene expression analysis to genetic association studies. In its original setting, volcano plots are scatter plots of fold-change and t-test statistic (or -log of the p-value), with the latter being more sensitive to sample size. In genetic association studies, the OR and Pearson's chi-square statistic (or equivalently its square root, chi; or the standardized log(OR)) can be analogously used in a volcano plot, allowing for their visual inspection. Moreover, the geometric interpretation of these plots leads to an intuitive method for filtering results by a combination of both OR and chi-square statistic, which we term "regularized-chi". This method selects associated markers by a smooth curve in the volcano plot instead of the right-angled lines which corresponds to independent cutoffs for OR and chi-square statistic. The regularized-chi incorporates relatively more signals from variants with lower minor-allele-frequencies than chi-square test statistic. As rare variants tend to have stronger functional effects, regularized-chi is better suited to the task of prioritization of candidate genes.},

	Abstract = {Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae expresses an uptake hydrogenase in symbiosis with peas (Pisum sativum) but, unlike all other characterized hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, cannot express it in free-living conditions. The hydrogenase-specific transcriptional activator gene hoxA described in other species was shown to have been inactivated in R. leguminosarum by accumulation of frameshift and deletion mutations. Symbiotic transcription of hydrogenase structural genes hupSL originates from a -24/-12 type promoter (hupSp). A regulatory region located in the -173 to -88 region was essential for promoter activity in R. leguminosarum. Activation of hupSp was observed in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli cells expressing the K. pneumoniae nitrogen fixation regulator NifA, and in E. coli cells expressing R. meliloti NifA. This activation required direct interaction of NifA with the essential -173 to -88 regulatory region. However, no sequences resembling known NifA-binding sites were found in or around this region. NifA-dependent activation was also observed in R. etli bean bacteroids. NifA-dependent hupSp activity in heterologous hosts was also absolutely dependent on the RpoN sigma-factor and on integration host factor. Proteins immunologically related to integration host factor were identified in R. leguminosarum. The data suggest that hupSp is structurally and functionally similar to nitrogen fixation promoters. The requirement to coordinate nitrogenase-dependent H2 production and H2 oxidation in nodules might be the reason for the loss of HoxA in R. leguminosarum and the concomitant NifA control of hup gene expression. This evolutionary acquired control would ensure regulated synthesis of uptake hydrogenase in the most common H2-rich environment for rhizobia, the legume nodule.},

	Abstract = {Prokaryotic chromosomes code for toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci, often in multiple copies. In E.coli, experimental evidence indicates that TA loci are stress-response elements that help cells survive unfavorable growth conditions. The first gene in a TA operon codes for an antitoxin that combines with and neutralizes a regulatory 'toxin', encoded by the second gene. RelE and MazF toxins are regulators of translation that cleave mRNA and function, in interplay with tmRNA, in quality control of gene expression. Here, we present the results from an exhaustive search for TA loci in 126 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes (16 archaea and 110 bacteria). We identified 671 TA loci belonging to the seven known TA gene families. Surprisingly, obligate intracellular organisms were devoid of TA loci, whereas free-living slowly growing prokaryotes had particularly many (38 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 43 in Nitrosomonas europaea). In many cases, TA loci were clustered and closely linked to mobile genetic elements. In the most extreme of these cases, all 13 TA loci of Vibrio cholerae were bona fide integron elements located in the V.cholerae mega-integron. These observations strongly suggest that TA loci are mobile cassettes that move frequently within and between chromosomes and also lend support to the hypothesis that TA loci function as stress-response elements beneficial to free-living prokaryotes.},

Retention time information can be easily extracted from LC-MS data and it can be used to improve protein identification/characterization procedures. The key to the success of this procedure is the correct retention time prediction based on compositional and structural properties of the separated species. Our Sequence Specific Retention Calculator (SSRCalc) is a Web-based peptide retention prediction that covers the separation selectivity of the most popular RP-HPLC conditions applied in proteomics. Procedures for the application of SSRCalc to proteomic analyses are described in this unit.},

@article{Gourion:2009aa,
	Abstract = {PhyR is an unusual type of response regulator consisting of a receiver domain and an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor-like domain. It was recently described as a master regulator of general stress response in Methylobacterium extorquens. Orthologues of this regulator are present in essentially all free-living Alphaproteobacteria. In most of them, phyR is genetically closely linked to a gene encoding an ECF sigma factor. Here, we investigate the role of these two regulators in the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110. Using deletion mutants and phenotypic assays, we showed that PhyR and the ECF sigma factor sigma(EcfG) are involved in heat shock and desiccation resistance upon carbon starvation. Both mutants had symbiotic defects on the plant hosts Glycine max (soybean) and Vigna radiata (mungbean). They induced fewer nodules than the wild type and these nodules were smaller, less pigmented, and their specific nitrogenase activity was drastically reduced 2 or 3 weeks after inoculation. Four weeks after infection, soybean nodule development caught up to a large extent whereas most mungbean nodules remained defective even 5 weeks after infection. Remarkably, both mutants triggered aberrant nodules on the different host plants with ectopically emerging roots. Microarray analysis revealed that PhyR and sigma(EcfG) control congruent regulons suggesting both regulators are part of the same signalling cascade. This finding was further substantiated by in vitro protein-protein interaction studies which are in line with a partner-switching mechanism controlling gene regulation triggered by phosphorylation of PhyR. The large number of genes of unknown function present in the PhyR/sigma(EcfG) regulon and the conspicuous symbiotic phenotype suggest that these regulators are involved in the Bradyrhizobium-legume interaction via yet undisclosed mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {In Bradyrhizobium japonicum, as in some other rhizobia, symbiotic efficiency is influenced by a type III secretion system (T3SS). Most genes encoding the transport machinery and secreted proteins are preceded by a conserved 30-bp motif, the type-three secretion (tts) box. In this study, we found that regions downstream of 34 tts boxes are transcribed. For nopB, nopL, and gunA2, the transcriptional start sites were found to be 12, 11, and 10 bp downstream of their tts boxes, respectively. The deletion of this motif or modification of two or more conserved residues strongly reduced expression of nopB. This indicates that the tts box is an essential promoter element. Data obtained with lacZ reporter gene fusions of five genes preceded by a tts box (gunA2, nopB, rhcV, nopL, and blr1806) revealed that they are expressed in 4-week-old nodules of Macroptilium atropurpureum. These data suggest that the T3SS is active in mature nitrogen-fixing nodules. The two-component response regulator TtsI is required for the expression of rhcV, nopL, and blr1806 in bacteroids. Staining of inoculated roots showed that nopB is also expressed in early infection stages.},

	Abstract = {We have detected activity of the nitrogen fixation regulatory protein NIFA of Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro. To do so we directed synthesis of NIFA in a coupled transcription-translation system and detected its ability to activate expression of a translational fusion between the nifH and lacZ genes. We infer that NIFA stimulates initiation of transcription by sigma 54 holoenzyme from the nifHDK promoter. The activity of NIFA was lost rapidly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 30 degrees C and was lost somewhat less rapidly at 0 degrees C. Loss of activity was not accompanied by degradation of NIFA polypeptide. Loss of activity was approximately exponential and was not affected by NIFA concentration over a 5-fold range. Therefore, NIFA inactivation does not appear to be due to self-association. We found that the factor in crude extracts previously demonstrated to bind to the nifHDK promoter-regulatory region [Beynon, J., Cannon, M., Buchanan-Wollaston, V., and Cannon, F. (1983) Cell 34, 665-671] is the integration host factor, which is known to bend DNA. Since the binding site for integration host factor lies between the upstream binding site for NIFA and the nifHDK promoter, integration host factor may bend the DNA between these two sites to facilitate productive interactions between NIFA and sigma 54 holoenzyme.},

@article{Margolin:2006ab,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.},

	Abstract = {Retention time prediction of peptides in liquid chromatography has proven to be a valuable tool for mass spectrometry-based proteomics, especially in designing more efficient procedures for state-of-the-art targeted workflows. Additionally, accurate retention time predictions can also be used to increase confidence in identifications in shotgun experiments. Despite these obvious benefits, the use of such methods has so far not been extended to (posttranslationally) modified peptides due to the absence of efficient predictors for such peptides. We here therefore describe a new retention time predictor for modified peptides, built on the foundations of our existing Elude algorithm. We evaluated our software by applying it on five types of commonly encountered modifications. Our results show that Elude now yields equally good prediction performances for modified and unmodified peptides, with correlation coefficients between predicted and observed retention times ranging from 0.93 to 0.98 for all the investigated datasets. Furthermore, we show that our predictor handles peptides carrying multiple modifications as well. This latest version of Elude is fully portable to new chromatographic conditions and can readily be applied to other types of posttranslational modifications. Elude is available under the permissive Apache2 open source License at http://per-colator.com or can be run via a web-interface at http://elude.sbc.su.se.},

	Abstract = {Cellular RNAs that do not function as messenger RNAs (mRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs) or ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) comprise a diverse class of molecules that are commonly referred to as non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These molecules have been known for quite a while, but their importance was not fully appreciated until recent genome-wide searches discovered thousands of these molecules and their genes in a variety of model organisms. Some of these screens were based on biocomputational prediction of ncRNA candidates within entire genomes of model organisms. Alternatively, direct biochemical isolation of expressed ncRNAs from cells, tissues or entire organisms has been shown to be a powerful approach to identify ncRNAs both at the level of individual molecules and at a global scale. In this review, we will survey several such wet-lab strategies, i.e. direct sequencing of ncRNAs, shotgun cloning of small-sized ncRNAs (cDNA libraries), microarray analysis and genomic SELEX to identify novel ncRNAs, and discuss the advantages and limits of these approaches.},

Somatic tumor genome sequences provide a rich new source of data for uncovering these subtypes but have proven difficult to compare, as two tumors rarely share the same mutations. Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.},

@article{Pfeifer:2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput peptide and protein identification technologies have benefited tremendously from strategies based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in combination with database searching algorithms. A major problem with existing methods lies within the significant number of false positive and false negative annotations. So far, standard algorithms for protein identification do not use the information gained from separation processes usually involved in peptide analysis, such as retention time information, which are readily available from chromatographic separation of the sample. Identification can thus be improved by comparing measured retention times to predicted retention times. Current prediction models are derived from a set of measured test analytes but they usually require large amounts of training data.

RESULTS: We introduce a new kernel function which can be applied in combination with support vector machines to a wide range of computational proteomics problems. We show the performance of this new approach by applying it to the prediction of peptide adsorption/elution behavior in strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction (SAX-SPE) and ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC). Furthermore, the predicted retention times are used to improve spectrum identifications by a p-value-based filtering approach. The approach was tested on a number of different datasets and shows excellent performance while requiring only very small training sets (about 40 peptides instead of thousands). Using the retention time predictor in our retention time filter improves the fraction of correctly identified peptide mass spectra significantly.

CONCLUSION: The proposed kernel function is well-suited for the prediction of chromatographic separation in computational proteomics and requires only a limited amount of training data. The performance of this new method is demonstrated by applying it to peptide retention time prediction in IP-RP-HPLC and prediction of peptide sample fractionation in SAX-SPE. Finally, we incorporate the predicted chromatographic behavior in a p-value based filter to improve peptide identifications based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.},

@article{Chao:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The small RNAs associated with the protein Hfq constitute one of the largest classes of post-transcriptional regulators known to date. Most previously investigated members of this class are encoded by conserved free-standing genes. Here, deep sequencing of Hfq-bound transcripts from multiple stages of growth of Salmonella typhimurium revealed a plethora of new small RNA species from within mRNA loci, including DapZ, which overlaps with the 3' region of the biosynthetic gene, dapB. Synthesis of the DapZ small RNA is independent of DapB protein synthesis, and is controlled by HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion genes. DapZ carries a short G/U-rich domain similar to that of the globally acting GcvB small RNA, and uses GcvB-like seed pairing to repress translation of the major ABC transporters, DppA and OppA. This exemplifies double functional output from an mRNA locus by the production of both a protein and an Hfq-dependent trans-acting RNA. Our atlas of Hfq targets suggests that the 3' regions of mRNA genes constitute a rich reservoir that provides the Hfq network with new regulatory small RNAs.},

	Abstract = {The core of every protein mass spectrometry analysis pipeline is a function that assesses the quality of a match between an observed spectrum and a candidate peptide. We describe a procedure for computing exact p-values for the oldest and still widely used score function, SEQUEST XCorr. The procedure uses dynamic programming to enumerate efficiently the full distribution of scores for all possible peptides whose masses are close to that of the spectrum precursor mass. Ranking identified spectra by p-value rather than XCorr significantly reduces variance due to spectrum-specific effects on the score. In combination with the Percolator post-processor, the XCorr p-value yields more spectrum and peptide identifications at a fixed false discovery rate than Mascot, X!Tandem, Comet, and MS-GF+ across a variety of data sets.},

A further 96 unique protein targets are assayed in plasma by laboratory-developed tests available for clinical use in the US, yielding a total of 205 proteins that include products of approximately 211 genes (excluding immunoglobulins). These tests provide quantitative measurements for approximately 1{\%} of the human protein gene products, defining a practical clinical plasma proteome. The rate of introduction of new protein analytes has remained essentially flat over the past 15 years, averaging 1.5 new proteins per year (median of 1 per year). This rate falls far short of that needed to support projected medical needs and indicates serious deficiencies in the protein biomarker pipeline, from which no proteomics-discovered analytes have yet emerged.},

	Abstract = {No universally accepted score is currently available to determine when a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) experiment has been successfully carried out. We describe a software program (ChemApplex) based on a calculated parameter (Combined Protein Score) that takes into account (1) peak intensity, (2) the mass accuracy of the match, and (3) ChemScore, a theoretical intensity factor that estimates the probability of observing a particular peptide based on a combination of chemical considerations, in particular the amino acid composition of the peptide and the amino acid sequence of the amino acids that span the cleavage site. When these three factors are taken into account both at the level of individual peptides and at the protein level, protein components in mixtures whose peptides contribute less than 1{\%} of the total intensity can often be correctly identified, as is demonstrated for mixtures of standard proteins. Moreover, it is possible to make robust database identifications that are nearly independent of the number of masses submitted and the mass error threshold used for matching. Protein scoring based on Combined Protein Score is orthogonal to many of the commonly used probability-based scoring schemes, and makes it possible to archive a more complete set of parameters that more thoroughly characterize the validity of the database match, which increases the confidence in the identifications.

However, as data continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the appropriate normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method on the downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice.

	Abstract = {Cosmid-borne and chromosomal lacZ fusions to aapJ, aapQ and aapM were used to examine the nitrogen regulation of the general amino acid permease (Aap) of Rhizobium leguminosarum strain 3841. Transcription of the first gene of the operon (aapJ), which encodes the periplasmic binding protein, was 2--4-fold higher than aapQ and aapM, which encode the integral membrane proteins, under various growth conditions. This may be due to the presence of a putative stem loop in the intergenic region between aapJ and aapQ. All aap fusions were derepressed 3--5-fold after growth on glutamate as a nitrogen source, which effectively causes nitrogen limitation. An ntrC mutant was derepressed for transcription of the aap operon and had high rates of amino acid transport when grown on ammonia as the nitrogen source. Thus NtrC negatively regulates the aap operon, contrary to its usual role in positive gene activation. These results confirm that the aap operon is subject to complex regulation involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional factors.},

	Abstract = {The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system (T6SS) assembles as a molecular syringe that injects toxic protein effectors into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. We previously reported that the V. cholerae O37 serogroup strain V52 maintains a constitutively active T6SS to kill other Gram-negative bacteria while being immune to attack by kin bacteria. The pandemic O1 El Tor V. cholerae strain C6706 is T6SS-silent under laboratory conditions as it does not produce T6SS structural components and effectors, and fails to kill Escherichia coli prey. Yet, C6706 exhibits full resistance when approached by T6SS-active V52. These findings suggested that an active T6SS is not required for immunity against T6SS-mediated virulence. Here, we describe a dual expression profile of the T6SS immunity protein-encoding genes tsiV1, tsiV2, and tsiV3 that provides pandemic V. cholerae strains with T6SS immunity and allows T6SS-silent strains to maintain immunity against attacks by T6SS-active bacterial neighbors. The dual expression profile allows transcription of the three genes encoding immunity proteins independently of other T6SS proteins encoded within the same operon. One of these immunity proteins, TsiV2, protects against the T6SS effector VasX which is encoded immediately upstream of tsiV2. VasX is a secreted, lipid-binding protein that we previously characterized with respect to T6SS-mediated virulence towards the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Our data suggest the presence of an internal promoter in the open reading frame of vasX that drives expression of the downstream gene tsiV2. Furthermore, VasX is shown to act in conjunction with VasW, an accessory protein to VasX, to compromise the inner membrane of prokaryotic target cells. The dual regulatory profile of the T6SS immunity protein-encoding genes tsiV1, tsiV2, and tsiV3 permits V. cholerae to tightly control T6SS gene expression while maintaining immunity to T6SS activity.},

	Abstract = {The Bradyrhizobium japonicum fixX gene was identified and shown to be essential for symbiotic and free-living, microaerobic nitrogen fixation. The fixX gene encodes a ferredoxin-like protein which may be involved in a redox process (electron transport?) essential for nitrogenase activity. This gene was localized downstream of fixC and its expression was dependent on the fixB promoter, providing evidence for the existence of a fixBCX operon. Mutagenesis and sequence analysis of the unusually long, 709bp leader region between the fixB promoter and the fixB structural gene did not reveal the presence of a nif or fix gene that was absolutely essential for nitrogen fixation. However, a short open reading frame (ORF) within this region encoding a polypeptide of 35 amino acids (ORF35) was shown to be efficiently translated. Chromosomal deletion of a 400bp DNA fragment covering ORF35 resulted in a three-fold reduction of the fixBCX mRNA level, which in turn also reduced the nitrogen fixation activity of this mutant. This suggests a possible post-transcriptional control mechanism for the expression of the fixBCX operon involving the stabilization of fixBCX mRNA by ribosomes actively translating ORF35.},

@article{Mekler2012,
	Abstract = {Transcription initiation complexes formed by bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) exhibit dramatic species-specific differences in stability, leading to different strategies of transcription regulation. The molecular basis for this diversity is unclear. Promoter complexes formed by RNAP from Thermus aquaticus (Taq) are considerably less stable than Escherichia coli RNAP promoter complexes, particularly at temperatures below 37$\,^{\circ}$C. Here, we used a fluorometric RNAP molecular beacon assay to discern partial RNAP-promoter interactions. We quantitatively compared the strength of E. coli and Taq RNAPs partial interactions with the -10, -35 and UP promoter elements; the TG motif of the extended -10 element; the discriminator and the downstream duplex promoter segments. We found that compared with Taq RNAP, E. coli RNAP has much higher affinity only to the UP element and the downstream promoter duplex. This result indicates that the difference in stability between E. coli and Taq promoter complexes is mainly determined by the differential strength of core RNAP-DNA contacts. We suggest that the relative weakness of Taq RNAP interactions with DNA downstream of the transcription start point is the major reason of low stability and temperature sensitivity of promoter complexes formed by this enzyme.},

	Abstract = {Spectral library searching is a promising alternative to sequence database searching in peptide identification from MS/MS spectra. The key advantage of spectral library searching is the utilization of more spectral features to improve score discrimination between good and bad matches, and hence sensitivity. However, the coverage of reference spectral library is limited by current experimental and computational methods. We developed a computational approach to expand the coverage of spectral libraries with semi-empirical spectra predicted from perturbing known spectra of similar sequences, such as those with single amino acid substitutions. We hypothesized that the peptide of similar sequences should produce similar fragmentation patterns, at least in most cases. Our results confirm our hypothesis and specify when this approach can be applied. In actual spectral searching of real data sets, the sensitivity advantage of spectral library searching over sequence database searching can be mostly retained even when all real spectra are replaced by semi-empirical ones. We demonstrated the applicability of this approach by detecting several known non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in three large human data sets by spectral searching.},

@article{Hu2010,
	Abstract = {The (Mo)-nitrogenase is a complex metalloenzyme that catalyzes the key step in the global nitrogen cycle, the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen (N(2)) to bioavailable ammonia (NH(3)), at the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) site of its molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein component. Despite the fundamental significance of biological nitrogen fixation and extensive studies over the past decades, the catalytic mechanism of nitrogenase has not been deciphered. One major challenge for the mechanistic study of nitrogenase is the redox versatility of its FeMoco center. The ability of FeMoco to shuttle between oxidation states in a rapid and unsynchronized manner results in a mixed oxidation state of the cofactor population during turnover. The substrate and the various intermediates can only interact with the FeMoco site in a transient manner, so it is extremely difficult to capture any substrate- or intermediate-bound form of nitrogenase for the direct examination of substrate-enzyme interactions during catalysis. In this Account, we describe the approach of identifying a partially "defective" nitrogenase homologue, one with a slower turnover rate, as a means of overcoming this problem. The NifEN protein complex serves as an ideal candidate for this purpose. It is an alpha(2)beta(2)-heterotetramer that contains cluster-binding sites homologous to those found in the MoFe protein: the "P-cluster site" at the interface of the alphabeta-subunit dimer, which accommodates a [Fe(4)S(4)]-type cluster; and the "FeMoco site" within the alpha-subunit, which houses an all-iron homologue to the FeMoco. Moreover, NifEN mimics the MoFe protein in catalysis: it is capable of reducing acetylene (C(2)H(2)) and azide (N(3)(-)) in an ATP- and iron (Fe) protein-dependent manner. However, NifEN is unable to reduce proton (H(+)) and N(2), and it is an inefficient enzyme with a restricted electron flux during the turnover. The extremely slow turnover rate of NifEN and the possible "synchronization" of its FeMoco homologue at a certain oxidation level permit the observation of a new S = 1/2 EPR signal upon turnover of C(2)H(2) by NifEN, which is analogous to the signal reported for a MoFe protein variant upon turnover of the same substrate. This result is exciting, because it suggests the possibility of naturally enriching a C(2)H(2)-bound form of NifEN for the successful crystallization of the first intermediate-bound nitrogenase homologue. On the other hand, the fact that NifEN represents a partially "defective" homologue of the MoFe protein makes it a promising mutational platform on which a functional MoFe protein equivalent may be reconstructed by introducing the missing features of MoFe protein step-by-step into NifEN. Such a strategy allows us to define the function of each feature and address questions such as the following: What is the function of P-cluster in catalysis? Are Mo and homocitrate the essential constituents of the cofactor in N(2) reduction? How does substrate accessibility affect the reactivity of the enzyme? This homologue approach could complement the mechanistic analysis of the nitrogenase MoFe protein, and information derived from both approaches will help achieve the ultimate goal of solving the riddle of biological nitrogen fixation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data mining in large DNA sequences is a major challenge in microbial genomics and bioinformatics. Oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns provide a wealth of information for large scale sequence analysis and visualization. The purpose of this research was to make OU statistical analysis available as a novel web-based tool for functional genomics and annotation. The tool is also available as a downloadable package.

RESULTS: The SeqWord Genome Browser (SWGB) was developed to visualize the natural compositional variation of DNA sequences. The applet is also used for identification of divergent genomic regions both in annotated sequences of bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, phages and viruses, and in raw DNA sequences prior to annotation by comparing local and global OU patterns. The applet allows fast and reliable identification of clusters of horizontally transferred genomic islands, large multi-domain genes and genes for ribosomal RNA. Within the majority of genomic fragments (also termed genomic core sequence), regions enriched with housekeeping genes, ribosomal proteins and the regions rich in pseudogenes or genetic vestiges may be contrasted.

CONCLUSION: The SWGB applet presents a range of comprehensive OU statistical parameters calculated for a range of bacterial species, plasmids and phages. It is available on the Internet at http://www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/mhhapplet.php.},

	Abstract = {The plant growth-promoting bacterium (PGPB) Pseudomonas sp. UW4, previously isolated from the rhizosphere of common reeds growing on the campus of the University of Waterloo, promotes plant growth in the presence of different environmental stresses, such as flooding, high concentrations of salt, cold, heavy metals, drought and phytopathogens. In this work, the genome sequence of UW4 was obtained by pyrosequencing and the gaps between the contigs were closed by directed PCR. The P. sp. UW4 genome contains a single circular chromosome that is 6,183,388 bp with a 60.05{\%} G+C content. The bacterial genome contains 5,423 predicted protein-coding sequences that occupy 87.2{\%} of the genome. Nineteen genomic islands (GIs) were predicted and thirty one complete putative insertion sequences were identified. Genes potentially involved in plant growth promotion such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, trehalose production, siderophore production, acetoin synthesis, and phosphate solubilization were determined. Moreover, genes that contribute to the environmental fitness of UW4 were also observed including genes responsible for heavy metal resistance such as nickel, copper, cadmium, zinc, molybdate, cobalt, arsenate, and chromate. Whole-genome comparison with other completely sequenced Pseudomonas strains and phylogeny of four concatenated "housekeeping" genes (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD) of 128 Pseudomonas strains revealed that UW4 belongs to the fluorescens group, jessenii subgroup.},

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of 261 species in the class 'Alphaproteobacteria' were obtained from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ for constructing a phylogenetic tree by using maximum-likelihood analysis. In the resulting tree, members of the class 'Alphaproteobacteria' were subdivided into five major clusters, which were compared with the taxonomic outline of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Biology and the arb tree. Based on this phylogenetic tree, three novel families are proposed: Hyphomonadaceae fam. nov. to accommodate the bacterial genera Hyphomonas, Hirschia, Maricaulis and Oceanicaulis, Xanthobacteraceae fam. nov. to include the genera Xanthobacter, Azorhizobium, Ancylobacter, Labrys and Starkeya, and Erythrobacteraceae fam. nov. to accommodate the genera Erythrobacter, Porphyrobacter and Erythromicrobium. The phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA gene sequences established in this study may provide a sound basis for future taxonomic reconstruction of the class 'Alphaproteobacteria'.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide analysis of gene expression or protein binding patterns using different array or sequencing based technologies is now routinely performed to compare different populations, such as treatment and reference groups. It is often necessary to normalize the data obtained to remove technical variation introduced in the course of conducting experimental work, but standard normalization techniques are not capable of eliminating technical bias in cases where the distribution of the truly altered variables is skewed, i.e. when a large fraction of the variables are either positively or negatively affected by the treatment. However, several experiments are likely to generate such skewed distributions, including ChIP-chip experiments for the study of chromatin, gene expression experiments for the study of apoptosis, and SNP-studies of copy number variation in normal and tumour tissues. A preliminary study using spike-in array data established that the capacity of an experiment to identify altered variables and generate unbiased estimates of the fold change decreases as the fraction of altered variables and the skewness increases. We propose the following work-flow for analyzing high-dimensional experiments with regions of altered variables: (1) Pre-process raw data using one of the standard normalization techniques. (2) Investigate if the distribution of the altered variables is skewed. (3) If the distribution is not believed to be skewed, no additional normalization is needed. Otherwise, re-normalize the data using a novel HMM-assisted normalization procedure. (4) Perform downstream analysis. Here, ChIP-chip data and simulated data were used to evaluate the performance of the work-flow. It was found that skewed distributions can be detected by using the novel DSE-test (Detection of Skewed Experiments). Furthermore, applying the HMM-assisted normalization to experiments where the distribution of the truly altered variables is skewed results in considerably higher sensitivity and lower bias than can be attained using standard and invariant normalization methods.},

We report gel filtration and quantitative DNase I footprint experiments supporting a model in which DctD2 binds to these sites cooperatively. The global analysis of upstream activation sequences containing sites A and B, A and B one-half helical turn out of phase, and only B yielded values for the intrinsic and cooperative binding free energies of DeltaG0A = -9.5 +/- 0.3, DeltaG0B = -11.2 +/- 0.2, and DeltaG0AB = -2.5 +/- 0.5. A separate analysis of data from upstream activation sequences containing site A and a point mutant of site B, and site A and mutant site B one-half helical turn out of phase confirmed the estimate of cooperativity, yielding free energy values of DeltaG0A = -9.4 +/- 0.2, DeltaG0B(G--{\textgreater}C) = -10.0 +/- 0.2, and DeltaG0AB(G--{\textgreater}C) = -2.2 +/- 0.4. We previously showed that removing the two-component receiver domain from DctD, making DctDDelta(1-142), yields a constitutively active truncated protein. Global analysis of binding data for DctDDelta(1-142) showed that this constitutively active mutant has intrinsic binding energies equal to that of the inactive DctD protein, but that it displays significantly higher cooperativity (DeltaG0A = -9.4 +/- 0.6, DeltaG0B = -11.1 +/- 0.3, and DeltaG0AB = -3.8 +/- 0.6.).},

	Abstract = {The availability of next-generation sequences of transcripts from prokaryotic organisms offers the opportunity to design a new generation of automated genome annotation tools not yet available for prokaryotes. In this work, we designed EuGene-P, the first integrative prokaryotic gene finder tool which combines a variety of high-throughput data, including oriented RNA-Seq data, directly into the prediction process. This enables the automated prediction of coding sequences (CDSs), untranslated regions, transcription start sites (TSSs) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA, sense and antisense) genes. EuGene-P was used to comprehensively and accurately annotate the genome of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 2011, leading to the prediction of 6308 CDSs as well as 1876 ncRNAs. Among them, 1280 appeared as antisense to a CDS, which supports recent findings that antisense transcription activity is widespread in bacteria. Moreover, 4077 TSSs upstream of protein-coding or non-coding genes were precisely mapped providing valuable data for the study of promoter regions. By looking for RpoE2-binding sites upstream of annotated TSSs, we were able to extend the S. meliloti RpoE2 regulon by ∼3-fold. Altogether, these observations demonstrate the power of EuGene-P to produce a reliable and high-resolution automatic annotation of prokaryotic genomes.},

@article{Mesa2008a,
	Abstract = {Symbiotic N(2) fixation in Bradyrhizobium japonicum is controlled by a complex transcription factor network. Part of it is a hierarchically arranged cascade in which the two-component regulatory system FixLJ, in response to a moderate decrease in oxygen concentration, activates the fixK(2) gene. The FixK(2) protein then activates not only a number of genes essential for microoxic respiration in symbiosis (fixNOQP and fixGHIS) but also further regulatory genes (rpoN(1), nnrR, and fixK(1)). The results of transcriptome analyses described here have led to a comprehensive and expanded definition of the FixJ, FixK(2), and FixK(1) regulons, which, respectively, consist of 26, 204, and 29 genes specifically regulated in microoxically grown cells. Most of these genes are subject to positive control. Particular attention was addressed to the FixK(2)-dependent genes, which included a bioinformatics search for putative FixK(2) binding sites on DNA (FixK(2) boxes). Using an in vitro transcription assay with RNA polymerase holoenzyme and purified FixK(2) as the activator, we validated as direct targets eight new genes. Interestingly, the adjacent but divergently oriented fixK(1) and cycS genes shared the same FixK(2) box for the activation of transcription in both directions. This recognition site may also be a direct target for the FixK(1) protein, because activation of the cycS promoter required an intact fixK(1) gene and either microoxic or anoxic, denitrifying conditions. We present evidence that cycS codes for a c-type cytochrome which is important, but not essential, for nitrate respiration. Two other, unexpected results emerged from this study: (i) specifically FixK(1) seemed to exert a negative control on genes that are normally activated by the N(2) fixation-specific transcription factor NifA, and (ii) a larger number of genes are expressed in a FixK(2)-dependent manner in endosymbiotic bacteroids than in culture-grown cells, pointing to a possible symbiosis-specific control.},

@article{Passalacqua:2012aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genome-wide transcriptional analysis has been used for many years to study bacterial gene expression, many aspects of the bacterial transcriptome remain undefined. One example is antisense transcription, which has been observed in a number of bacteria, though the function of antisense transcripts, and their distribution across the bacterial genome, is still unclear.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Single-stranded RNA-seq results revealed a widespread and non-random pattern of antisense transcription covering more than two thirds of the B. anthracis genome. Our analysis revealed a variety of antisense structural patterns, suggesting multiple mechanisms of antisense transcription. The data revealed several instances of sense and antisense expression changes in different growth conditions, suggesting that antisense transcription may play a role in the ways in which B. anthracis responds to its environment. Significantly, genome-wide antisense expression occurred at consistently higher levels on the lagging strand, while the leading strand showed very little antisense activity. Intrasample gene expression comparisons revealed a gene dosage effect in all growth conditions, where genes farthest from the origin showed the lowest overall range of expression for both sense and antisense directed transcription. Additionally, transcription from both strands was verified using a novel strand-specific assay. The variety of structural patterns we observed in antisense transcription suggests multiple mechanisms for this phenomenon, suggesting that some antisense transcription may play a role in regulating the expression of key genes, while some may be due to chromosome replication dynamics and transcriptional noise.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although the variety of structural patterns we observed in antisense transcription suggest multiple mechanisms for antisense expression, our data also clearly indicate that antisense transcription may play a genome-wide role in regulating the expression of key genes in Bacillus species. This study illustrates the surprising complexity of prokaryotic RNA abundance for both strands of a bacterial chromosome.},

	Abstract = {With the development of ultra-high-throughput technologies, the cost of sequencing bacterial genomes has been vastly reduced. As more genomes are sequenced, less time can be spent manually annotating those genomes, resulting in an increased reliance on automatic annotation pipelines. However, automatic pipelines can produce inaccurate genome annotation and their results often require manual curation. Here, we discuss the automatic and manual annotation of bacterial genomes, identify common problems introduced by the current genome annotation process and suggests potential solutions.},

	Abstract = {We report structural and functional analyses of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum fixGHIS genes, which map immediately downstream of the fixNOQP operon for the symbiotically essential cbb3-type heme-copper oxidase complex. Expression of fixGHIS, like that of fixNOQP, is strongly induced in cells grown microaerobically or anaerobically. A fixGHI deletion led to the same prominent phenotypes as those known from a fixNOQP deletion: defective symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Fix-) and decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in cells grown under oxygen deprivation. Only traces, if any, of cytochrome cbb3 subunits were present in membranes isolated from the delta fixGHI strain, as revealed by Western blot analysis with subunit-specific antibodies. This effect was not due to lack of fixNOQP transcription. The results suggested a critical involvement of the fixGHIS gene products in the assembly and/or stability of the cbb3-type heme-copper oxidase. On the basis of sequence similarities between the FixI protein and a Cu-transporting P-type ATPase (CopA) of Enterococcus hirae, and between FixG and a membrane-bound oxidoreductase (RdxA) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, we postulate that a membrane-bound FixGHIS complex might play a role in uptake and metabolism of copper required for the cbb3-type heme-copper oxidase.},

@article{Cho2014,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the transcription process, the RNA polymerase (RNAP) core enzyme requires a $\sigma$-factor to recognize the genomic location at which the process initiates. Although the crucial role of $\sigma$-factors has long been appreciated and characterized for many individual promoters, we do not yet have a genome-scale assessment of their function.

RESULTS: Using multiple genome-scale measurements, we elucidated the network of $\sigma$-factor and promoter interactions in Escherichia coli. The reconstructed network includes 4,724 $\sigma$-factor-specific promoters corresponding to transcription units (TUs), representing an increase of more than 300{\%} over what has been previously reported. The reconstructed network was used to investigate competition between alternative $\sigma$-factors (the $\sigma$70 and $\sigma$38 regulons), confirming the competition model of $\sigma$ substitution and negative regulation by alternative $\sigma$-factors. Comparison with $\sigma$-factor binding in Klebsiella pneumoniae showed that transcriptional regulation of conserved genes in closely related species is unexpectedly divergent.

CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed network reveals the regulatory complexity of the promoter architecture in prokaryotic genomes, and opens a path to the direct determination of the systems biology of their transcriptional regulatory networks.},

@article{Tedin:1999aa,
	Abstract = {In this study, we have examined the influence of initiation factors on translation initiation of leaderless mRNAs whose 5'-terminal residues are the A of the AUG initiating codon. A 1:1 ratio of initiation factors to ribosomes abolished ternary complex formation at the authentic start codon of different leaderless mRNAs. Supporting this observation, in vitro translation assays using limiting ribosome concentrations with competing leaderless lambda cl and Escherichia coli ompA mRNAs, the latter containing a canonical ribosome binding site, revealed reduced cl synthesis relative to OmpA in the presence of added initiation factors. Using in vitro toeprinting and in vitro translation assays, we show that this effect can be attributed to IF3. Moreover, in vivo studies revealed that the translational efficiency of a leaderless reporter gene is decreased with increased IF3 levels. These studies are corroborated by the observed increased translational efficiency of a leaderless reporter construct in an infC mutant strain unable to discriminate against non-standard start codons. These results suggest that, in the absence of a leader or a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the function(s) of IF3 limits stable 30S ternary complex formation.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. Background Preterm delivery remains the leading cause of perinatal mortality. Risk factors and biomarkers have traditionally failed to identify the majority of preterm deliveries. Objective To develop and validate a mass spectrometry-based serum test to predict spontaneous preterm delivery in asymptomatic pregnant women. Study Design A total of 5501 pregnant women were enrolled between 17 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks gestational age in the prospective Proteomic Assessment of Preterm Risk study at 11 sites in the United States between 2011 and 2013. Maternal blood was collected at enrollment and outcomes collected following delivery. Maternal serum was processed by a proteomic workflow, and proteins were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The discovery and verification process identified 2 serum proteins, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IBP4) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), as predictors of spontaneous preterm delivery. We evaluated a predictor using the log ratio of the measures of IBP4 and SHBG (IBP4/SHBG) in a clinical validation study to classify spontaneous preterm delivery cases ( {\textless} 37 0/7 weeks gestational age) in a nested case-control cohort different from subjects used in discovery and verification. Strict blinding and independent statistical analyses were employed. Results The predictor had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.75 and sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.74, respectively. The IBP4/SHBG predictor at this sensitivity and specificity had an odds ratio of 5.04 for spontaneous preterm delivery. Accuracy of the IBP4/SHBG predictor increased using earlier case-vs-control gestational age cutoffs (eg, {\textless} 35 0/7 vs ≥35 0/7 weeks gestational age). Importantly, higher-risk subjects defined by the IBP4/SHBG predictor score generally gave birth earlier than lower-risk subjects. Conclusion A serum-based molecular predictor identifies asymptomatic pregnant women at risk of spontaneous preterm delivery, which may provide utility in identifying women at risk at an early stage of pregnancy to allow for clinical intervention. This early detection would guide enhanced levels of care and accelerate development of clinical strategies to prevent preterm delivery.},

	Abstract = {Characterizing changes in protein-protein interactions associated with sequence variants (e.g., disease-associated mutations or splice forms) or following exposure to drugs, growth factors or hormones is critical to understanding how protein complexes are built, localized and regulated. Affinity purification (AP) coupled with mass spectrometry permits the analysis of protein interactions under near-physiological conditions, yet monitoring interaction changes requires the development of a robust and sensitive quantitative approach, especially for large-scale studies in which cost and time are major considerations. We have coupled AP to data-independent mass spectrometric acquisition (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra, SWATH) and implemented an automated data extraction and statistical analysis pipeline to score modulated interactions. We used AP-SWATH to characterize changes in protein-protein interactions imparted by the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 or melanoma-associated mutations in the human kinase CDK4. We show that AP-SWATH is a robust label-free approach to characterize such changes and propose a scalable pipeline for systems biology studies.},

It has been expected that genome analysis would elucidate the mechanism of magnetosome formation by magnetic bacteria. Here we describe the genome of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 wild type, which consists of a single circular chromosome of 4967148 bp. For identification of genes required for magnetosome formation, transposon mutagenesis and determination of magnetosome membrane proteins were performed. Analysis of a non-magnetic transposon mutant library focused on three unknown genes from 2752 unknown genes and three genes from 205 signal transduction genes. Partial proteome analysis of the magnetosome membrane revealed that the membrane contains numerous oxidation/reduction proteins and a signal response regulator that may function in magnetotaxis. Thus, oxidation/reduction proteins and elaborate multidomain signaling proteins were analyzed. This comprehensive genome analysis will enable resolution of the mechanisms of magnetosome formation and provide a template to determine how magnetic bacteria maintain a species-specific, nano-sized, magnetic single domain and paramagnetic morphology.},

NifA is believed to bind to specific sites, the upstream activator sequences (UAS's), of the nif promoters which it activates. We have now shown by mutation of the carboxy terminus of NifA that this is the DNA-binding domain and that the DNA-binding and positive activator functions of NifA can be separated. Mutational analysis of the nifH UAS and in vivo methylation protection analysis of the interaction of NifA with-theniifH promoter demonstrates that the UAS is recognised by the carboxy terminus of NifA. The UAS's of K. pneumoniae nif promoters are also required for activation by the Riiizobium meliloti NifA indicating that this activator also possesses DNA-binding activity.},

@article{Shimada2014,
	Abstract = {The promoter selectivity of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is determined by the sigma subunit with promoter recognition activity. The model prokaryote Escherichia coli contains seven species of the sigma subunit, each recognizing a specific set of promoters. The major sigma subunit, sigma-70 encoded by rpoD, plays a major role in transcription of growth-related genes. Concomitant with the increase in detection of promoters functioning in vivo under various stressful conditions, the variation is expanding in the consensus sequence of RpoD promoters. In order to identify the canonical sequence of "constitutive promoters" that are recognized by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing RpoD sigma in the absence of supporting transcription factors, an in vitro mixed transcription assay was carried out using a whole set of variant promoters, each harboring one base replacement, within the model promoter with the conserved -35 and -10 sequences of RpoD promoters. The consensus sequences, TTGACA(-35) and TATAAT(-10), were identified to be ideal for the maximum level of open complex formation and the highest rate of promoter opening, respectively. For identification of the full range of constitutive promoters on the E. coli genome, a total of 2,701 RpoD holoenzyme-binding sites were identified by Genomic SELEX screening, and using the reconfirmed consensus promoter sequence, a total of maximum 669 constitutive promoters were identified, implying that the majority of hitherto identified promoters represents the TF-dependent "inducible promoters". One unique feature of the constitutive promoters is the high level of promoter sequence conservation, about 85{\%} carrying five-out-of-six agreements with -35 or -10 consensus sequence. The list of constitutive promoters provides the community resource toward estimation of the inducible promoters that operate under various stressful conditions in nature.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The sinorhizobia are amongst the most well studied members of nitrogen-fixing root nodule bacteria and contribute substantial amounts of fixed nitrogen to the biosphere. While the alfalfa symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti RM 1021 was one of the first rhizobial strains to be completely sequenced, little information is available about the genomes of this large and diverse species group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Here we report the draft assembly and annotation of 48 strains of Sinorhizobium comprising five genospecies. While S. meliloti and S. medicae are taxonomically related, they displayed different nodulation patterns on diverse Medicago host plants, and have differences in gene content including those involved in conjugation and organic sulfur utilization. Genes involved in Nod-factor and polysaccharide biosynthesis, denitrification and Type III, IV, and VI secretion systems also vary within and between species. Symbiotic phenotyping and mutational analyses indicated that some Type IV secretion genes are symbiosis-related and involved in nitrogen fixation efficiency. Moreover, there is a correlation between the presence of Type IV secretion systems, heme biosynthesis and microaerobic denitrification genes, and symbiotic efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that each Sinorhizobium strain uses a slightly different strategy to obtain maximum compatibility with a host plant. This large genome data set provides useful information to better understand the functional features of five Sinorhizobium species, especially compatibility in legume-Sinorhizobium interactions. The diversity of genes present in the accessory genomes of members of this genus indicates that each bacterium has adopted slightly different strategies to interact with diverse plant genera and soil environments.},

	Abstract = {PII-like signal transduction proteins, which respond to the nitrogen status via covalent modification and signal the carbon status through the binding of 2-oxoglutarate, have been implicated in the regulation of nitrogen fixation in several diazotrophs. The NIFL-NIFA two-component regulatory system, which integrates metabolic signals to fine-tune regulation of nitrogenase synthesis in Azotobacter vinelandii, is a potential target for PII-mediated signal transduction. Here we demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of the A.vinelandii NIFL protein is stimulated by interaction with the non-uridylylated form of PII-like regulatory proteins. We also observe that the NIFL-NIFA system is directly responsive to 2-oxoglutarate. We propose that the PII protein signals the nitrogen status by interaction with the NIFL-NIFA system under conditions of nitrogen excess, and that the inhibitory activity of NIFL is relieved by elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate when PII is uridylylated under conditions of nitrogen limitation. Our observations suggest a model for signal transduction to the NIFL-NIFA system in response to carbon and nitrogen status which is clearly distinct from that suggested from studies on other diazotrophs.},

@article{Beck1997,
	Abstract = {By using a PCR approach, the Bradyrhizobium japonicum sigA gene, which encodes the primary RNA polymerase sigma factor, sigma80, was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was established. The deduced protein is highly homologous to the SigA protein of Rhizobium meliloti (72{\%} amino acid sequence identity) but less so to RpoD of Escherichia coli (51{\%} identity). Well conserved is the C-terminal end of the protein, which is probably involved in promoter recognition and binding of the RNA polymerase core enzyme. A remarkable feature of the primary sequence is an alanine- and proline-rich segment of 24 amino acids between conserved regions 1 and 2, which might function as an interdomain linker. We purified the B. japonicum RNA polymerase holoenzyme. One of the subunits had an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa and corresponded to the sigA gene product, as judged by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The purified RNA polymerase was used in an in vitro transcription system to determine the transcription start sites of the rrn and groESL4 operons. They were identical to those previously identified in vivo. The rrn promoter was cloned upstream of a rho-independent terminator, yielding a transcript of about 240 bases. This served as a suitable template to analyze promoter activity. Then mutant derivatives of the rrn promoter were constructed and tested in in vitro transcription experiments. Several base pairs essential for promoter activity were thus identified. The results suggest that the well-characterized -35/-10 promoter class is predominantly used in B. japonicum for the expression of "housekeeping" genes.},

	Abstract = {The nifA promoter of Herbaspirillum seropedicae contains potential NtrC, NifA and IHF binding sites together with a -12/-24 sigma(N)-dependent promoter. This region has now been investigated by deletion mutagenesis for the effect of NtrC and NifA on the expression of a nifA::lacZ fusion. A 5' end to the RNA was identified at position 641, 12 bp downstream from the -12/-24 promoter. Footprinting experiments showed that the G residues at positions -26 and -9 are hypermethylated, and that the region from -10 to +10 is partially melted under nitrogen-fixing conditions, confirming that this is the active nifA promoter. In H. seropedicae nifA expression from the sigma(N)-dependent promoter is repressed by fixed nitrogen but not by oxygen and is probably activated by the NtrC protein. NifA protein is apparently not essential for nifA expression but it can still bind the NifA upstream activating sequence.},

@article{Sinoquet2008,
	Abstract = {This article compares 32 bacterial genomes with respect to their high transcription potentialities. The sigma70 promoter has been widely studied for Escherichia coli model and a consensus is known. Since transcriptional regulations are known to compensate for promoter weakness (i.e. when the promoter similarity with regard to the consensus is rather low), predicting functional promoters is a hard task. Instead, the research work presented here comes within the scope of investigating potentially high ORF expression, in relation with three criteria: (i) high similarity to the sigma70 consensus (namely, the consensus variant appropriate for each genome), (ii) transcription strength reinforcement through a supplementary binding site--the upstream promoter (UP) element--and (iii) enhancement through an optimal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. We show that in the AT-rich Firmicutes' genomes, frequencies of potentially strong sigma70-like promoters are exceptionally high. Besides, though they contain a low number of strong promoters (SPs), some genomes may show a high proportion of promoters harbouring an UP element. Putative SPs of lesser quality are more frequently associated with an UP element than putative strong promoters of better quality. A meaningful difference is statistically ascertained when comparing bacterial genomes with similarly AT-rich genomes generated at random; the difference is the highest for Firmicutes. Comparing some Firmicutes genomes with similarly AT-rich Proteobacteria genomes, we confirm the Firmicutes specificity. We show that this specificity is neither explained by AT-bias nor genome size bias; neither does it originate in the abundance of optimal SD sequences, a typical and significant feature of Firmicutes more thoroughly analysed in our study.},

	Abstract = {The physical and genetic map of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum chromosome revealed that nitrogen fixation and nodulation genes are clustered. Because of the complex interactions between the bacterium and the plant, we expected this chromosomal sector to contain additional genes that are involved in the maintenance of an efficient symbiosis. Therefore, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 410-kb region. The overall GC nu- cleotide content was 59.1{\%}. Using a minimum gene length of 150 nucleotides, 388 open reading frames (ORFs) were selected as coding regions. Thirty-five percent of the predicted proteins showed similarity to proteins of rhizobia. Sixteen percent were similar only to proteins of other bacteria. No database match was found for 29{\%}. Repetitive DNA sequence-derived ORFs accounted for the rest. The sequenced region contained all nitrogen fixation genes and, apart from nodM, all nodulation genes that were known to exist in B. japonicum. We found several genes that seem to encode transport systems for ferric citrate, molybdate, or carbon sources. Some of them are preceded by 24/12 promoter elements. A number of putative outer membrane proteins and cell wall-modifying enzymes as well as a type III secretion system might be involved in the interaction with the host.},

	Abstract = {Rhodobacter capsulatus NtrC is an enhancer-binding protein that activates transcription of the R. capsulatus sigma 70 RNA polymerase, but does not activate the Escherichia coli sigma 70-RNA polymerase at the nifA1 promoter. We utilized R. capsulatus:E. coli hybrid RNA polymerases assembled in vitro to investigate the subunits required for protein-protein interaction with RcNtrC at the nifA1mut1 promoter. Assembly of core Rc alpha beta beta' or hybrid RNA polymerases containing the Rc beta beta' subunits absolutely require the inclusion of an omega subunit, with the Ec omega subunit only partially promoting RNA polymerase assembly. The Rc alpha Ec beta beta' RNA polymerase is not activated by RcNtrC. Moreover, a mutant form of the Rc alpha lacking the alpha C-terminal domain, when assembled with the Rc beta beta'omega and sigma 70 subunits, is activated by RcNtrC. These results suggest that the R. capsulatus alpha subunit is not important for RcNtrC interaction. All hybrid RNA polymerases that contained the Rc beta' were activated by RcNtrC, suggesting that the Rc beta' subunit plays an important role. It is proposed that RcNtrC recruits R. capsulatus sigma 70-RNA polymerase to the promoter through interaction with Rc beta'. RcNtrC interacts with RNA polymerase from a unique position, with dimers centered at -118 bp from the start site. Placing the RcNtrC tandem binding sites on the opposite face of the helix (-113 bp) completely abolished transcription activation. Moving the RcNtrC tandem binding sites 20 bp closer to or further from the promoter significantly reduced activation, again suggesting unique spatial constraints on how RcNtrC interacts with the R. capsulatus RNA polymerase.},

	Abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2016 {\v{C}}uklina et al. Background: Differential RNA-sequencing (dRNA-seq) is indispensable for determination of primary transcriptomes. However, using dRNA-seq data to map transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and promoters genome-wide is a bioinformatics challenge. We performed dRNA-seq of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110, the nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, and developed algorithms to map TSSs and promoters. Results: A specialized machine learning procedure for TSS recognition allowed us to map 15,923 TSSs: 14,360 in free-living bacteria, 4329 in symbiosis with soybean and 2766 in both conditions. Further, we provide proteomic evidence for 4090 proteins, among them 107 proteins corresponding to new genes and 178 proteins with Ntermini different from the existing annotation (72 and 109 of them with TSS support, respectively). Guided by proteomics evidence, previously identified TSSs and TSSs experimentally validated here, we assign a score threshold to flag 14 {\%} of the mapped TSSs as a class of lower confidence. However, this class of lower confidence contains valid TSSs of low-abundant transcripts. Moreover, we developed a de novo algorithm to identify promoter motifs upstream of mapped TSSs, which is publicly available, and found motifs mainly used in symbiosis (similar to RpoN-dependent promoters) or under both conditions (similar to RpoD-dependent promoters). Mapped TSSs and putative promoters, proteomic evidence and updated gene annotation were combined into an annotation file. Conclusions: The genome-wide TSS and promoter maps along with the extended genome annotation of B. japonicum represent a valuable resource for future systems biology studies and for detailed analyses of individual non-coding transcripts and ORFs. Our data will also provide new insights into bacterial gene regulation during the agriculturally important symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes.},

	Abstract = {The so-called symbiotic region of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum chromosome (C. K{\"{u}}ndig, H. Hennecke, and M. G{\"{o}}ttfert, J. Bacteriol. 175:613-622, 1993) was screened for the presence of genes controlled by the nitrogen fixation regulatory protein NifA. Southern blots of restriction enzyme-digested cosmids that represent an ordered, overlapping library of the symbiotic region were competitively hybridized with in vitro-labeled RNA from anaerobically grown wild-type cells and an excess of RNA isolated either from anaerobically grown nifA and rpoN mutant cells or from aerobically grown wild-type cells. In addition to the previously characterized nif and fix gene clusters, we identified three new NifA-regulated genes that were named nrgA, nrgB, and nrgC (nrg stands for NifA-regulated gene). The latter two probably form an operon, nrgBC. The proteins encoded by nrgC and nrgA exhibited amino acid sequence similarity to bacterial hydroxylases and N-acetyltransferases, respectively. The product of nrgB showed no significant similarity to any protein with a database entry. Primer extension experiments and expression studies with translational lacZ fusions revealed the presence of a functional -24/-12-type promoter upstream of nrgA and nrgBC and proved the NifA- and RpoN (sigma(54))-dependent transcription of the respective genes. Null mutations introduced into nrgA and nrgBC resulted in mutant strains that exhibited wild-type-like symbiotic properties, including nitrogen fixation, when tested on soybean, cowpea, or mung bean host plants. Thus, the discovery of nrgA and nrgBC further emphasizes the previously suggested role of NifA as an activator of anaerobically induced genes other than the classical nitrogen fixation genes.},

	Abstract = {The Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Calculator is a design method for predicting and controlling translation initiation and protein expression in bacteria. The method can predict the rate of translation initiation for every start codon in an mRNA transcript. The method may also optimize a synthetic RBS sequence to achieve a targeted translation initiation rate. Using the RBS Calculator, a protein coding sequence's translation rate may be rationally controlled across a 100,000+ fold range. We begin by providing an overview of the potential biotechnology applications of the RBS Calculator, including the optimization of synthetic metabolic pathways and genetic circuits. We then detail the definitions, methodologies, and algorithms behind the RBS Calculator's thermodynamic model and optimization method. Finally, we outline a protocol for precisely measuring steady-state fluorescent protein expression levels. These methods and protocols provide a clear explanation of the RBS Calculator and its uses.},

	Abstract = {Cancer is a highly variable disease with multiple heterogeneous genetic and epigenetic changes. Functional studies are essential to understanding the complexity and polymorphisms of cancer. The final deciphering of the complete human genome, together with the improvement of high throughput technologies, is causing a fundamental transformation in cancer research. Microarray is a new powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of interactions on a scale that is impossible using conventional analysis. This technique makes it possible to examine the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. This technology promises to lead to improvements in developing rational approaches to therapy as well as to improvements in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, assuring its entry into clinical practice in specialist centers and hospitals within the next few years. Predicting who will develop cancer and how this disease will behave and respond to therapy after diagnosis will be one of the potential benefits of this technology within the next decade. In this review, we highlight some of the recent developments and results in microarray technology in cancer research, discuss potentially problematic areas associated with it, describe the eventual use of microarray technology for clinical applications and comment on future trends and issues.},

@article{Dupuy:2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. There is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.

METHODS: Studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a Medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. Studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. We recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. A critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.

RESULTS: Ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. Sixty-eight (76{\%}) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. A detailed account of the 42 studies (47{\%}) published in 2004 is reported. Twenty-one (50{\%}) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.

CONCLUSIONS: The most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. Based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of "Do's and Don'ts," is provided.},

	Abstract = {After determination of the whole genome sequence, the research frontier of bacterial molecular genetics has shifted to reveal the genome regulation under stressful conditions in nature. The gene selectivity of RNA polymerase is modulated after interaction with two groups of regulatory proteins, 7 sigma factors and 300 transcription factors. For identification of regulation targets of transcription factors in Escherichia coli, we have developed Genomic SELEX system and subjected to screening the binding sites of these factors on the genome. The number of regulation targets by a single transcription factor was more than those hitherto recognized, ranging up to hundreds of promoters. The number of transcription factors involved in regulation of a single promoter also increased to as many as 30 regulators. The multi-target transcription factors and the multi-factor promoters were assembled into complex networks of transcription regulation. The most complex network was identified in the regulation cascades of transcription of two master regulators for planktonic growth and biofilm formation},

	Abstract = {A highly supported maximum-likelihood species phylogeny for the genus Bradyrhizobium was inferred from a supermatrix obtained from the concatenation of partial atpD, recA, glnII, and rpoB sequences corresponding to 33 reference strains and 76 bradyrhizobia isolated from the nodules of Glycine max (soybean) trap plants inoculated with soil samples from Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Vietnam. The power of the multigene approach using multiple strains per species was evaluated in terms of overall tree resolution and phylogenetic congruence, representing a practical and portable option for bacterial molecular systematics. Potential pitfalls of the approach are highlighted. Seventy-five of the isolates could be classified as B. japonicum type Ia (USDA110/USDA122-like), B. liaoningense, B. yuanmingense, or B. elkanii, whereas one represented a novel Bradyrhizobium lineage. Most Nepalese B. japonicum Ia isolates belong to a highly epidemic clone closely related to strain USDA110. Significant phylogenetic evidence against the monophyly of the of B. japonicum I and Ia lineages was found. Analysis of their DNA polymorphisms revealed high population distances, significant genetic differentiation, and contrasting population genetic structures, suggesting that the strains in the Ia lineage are misclassified as B. japonicum. The DNA polymorphism patterns of all species conformed to the expectations of the neutral mutation and population equilibrium models and, excluding the B. japonicum Ia lineage, were consistent with intermediate recombination levels. All species displayed epidemic clones and had broad geographic and environmental distribution ranges, as revealed by mapping climate types and geographic origins of the isolates on the species tree.},

	Abstract = {Genome annotation is a tedious task that is mostly done by automated methods; however, the accuracy of these approaches has been questioned since the beginning of the sequencing era. Genome annotation is a multilevel process, and errors can emerge at different stages: during sequencing, as a result of gene-calling procedures, and in the process of assigning gene functions. Missed or wrongly annotated genes differentially impact different types of analyses. Here we discuss and demonstrate how the methods of comparative genome analysis can refine annotations by locating missing orthologues. We also discuss possible reasons for errors and show that the second-generation annotation systems, which combine multiple gene-calling programs with similarity-based methods, perform much better than the first annotation tools. Since old errors may propagate to the newly sequenced genomes, we emphasize that the problem of continuously updating popular public databases is an urgent and unresolved one. Due to the progress in genome-sequencing technologies, automated annotation techniques will remain the main approach in the future. Researchers need to be aware of the existing errors in the annotation of even well-studied genomes, such as Escherichia coli, and consider additional quality control for their results.},

To achieve saturation coverage of a proteome or specific subproteome via tandem mass spectrometric identification of tryptic protein sample digests, proteomics data sets are growing dramatically in size and heterogeneity. The trend toward very large integrated data sets poses so far unsolved challenges to control the uncertainty of protein identifications going beyond well established confidence measures for peptide-spectrum matches. We present MAYU, a novel strategy that reliably estimates false discovery rates for protein identifications in large scale data sets. We validated and applied MAYU using various large proteomics data sets. The data show that the size of the data set has an important and previously underestimated impact on the reliability of protein identifications. We particularly found that protein false discovery rates are significantly elevated compared with those of peptide-spectrum matches. The function provided by MAYU is critical to control the quality of proteome data repositories and thereby to enhance any study relying on these data sources. The MAYU software is available as standalone software and also integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.},

Transcription of ntrY starts within the ntrC-ntrY intergenic region as shown by primer extension analysis, but maximal transcription requires, in addition, the promoter of the nifR3-ntrB-ntrC operon. While ntrB and ntrY single mutant strains were able to grow with either urea or N2 as sole nitrogen source, a ntrB/ntrY double mutant (like a ntrC-deficient strain) was no longer able to use urea or N2.

	Abstract = {We determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of a diazotrophic endophyte, Azospirillum sp. B510. Strain B510 is an endophytic bacterium isolated from stems of rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The genome of B510 consisted of a single chromosome (3,311,395 bp) and six plasmids, designated as pAB510a (1,455,109 bp), pAB510b (723,779 bp), pAB510c (681,723 bp), pAB510d (628,837 bp), pAB510e (537,299 bp), and pAB510f (261,596 bp). The chromosome bears 2893 potential protein-encoding genes, two sets of rRNA gene clusters (rrns), and 45 tRNA genes representing 37 tRNA species. The genomes of the six plasmids contained a total of 3416 protein-encoding genes, seven sets of rrns, and 34 tRNAs representing 19 tRNA species. Eight genes for plasmid-specific tRNA species are located on either pAB510a or pAB510d. Two out of eight genomic islands are inserted in the plasmids, pAB510b and pAB510e, and one of the islands is inserted into trnfM-CAU in the rrn located on pAB510e. Genes other than the nif gene cluster that are involved in N(2) fixation and are homologues of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 include fixABCX, fixNOQP, fixHIS, fixG, and fixLJK. Three putative plant hormone-related genes encoding tryptophan 2-monooxytenase (iaaM) and indole-3-acetaldehyde hydrolase (iaaH), which are involved in IAA biosynthesis, and ACC deaminase (acdS), which reduces ethylene levels, were identified. Multiple gene-clusters for tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic-transport systems and a diverse set of malic enzymes were identified, suggesting that B510 utilizes C(4)-dicarboxylate during its symbiotic relationship with the host plant.},

	Abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

	Abstract = {The nitrogen regulator II (NRII or NtrB)-NRI (NtrC) two-component signal transduction system regulates the transcription of nitrogen-regulated genes in Escherichia coli. The NRII protein has both kinase and phosphatase activities and catalyzes the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NRI, which activates transcription when phosphorylated. The phosphatase activity of NRII is activated by the PII signal transduction protein. We showed that PII was also an inhibitor of the kinase activity of NRII. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that the kinase and phosphatase activities of two-component system kinase/phosphatase proteins are coordinately and reciprocally regulated. The ability of PII to regulate NRII is allosterically controlled by the small-molecule effector 2-ketoglutarate, which binds to PII. We studied the effect of 2-ketoglutarate on the regulation of the kinase and phosphatase activities of NRII by PII, using a coupled enzyme system to measure the rate of cleavage of ATP by NRII. The data were consistent with the following hypothesis: when not complexed with 2-ketoglutarate, PII cannot bind to NRII and has no effect on its competing NRI kinase and phosphatase activities. Under these conditions, the kinase activity of NRII is dominant. At low 2-ketoglutarate concentrations, PII trimers complexed with a single molecule of 2-ketoglutarate interact with NRII to inhibit its kinase activity and activate its phosphatase activity. However, at high 2-ketoglutarate concentrations, PII binds additional ligand molecules and is rendered incapable of binding to NRII, thereby releasing inhibition of NRII's kinase activity and effectively inhibiting its phosphatase activity (by failing to stimulate it).},

	Abstract = {In global proteomic analysis, it is estimated that proteins span from millions to less than 100 copies per cell. The challenge of protein quantitation by classic shotgun proteomic techniques relies on the presence of missing values in peptides belonging to low-abundance proteins that lowers intraruns reproducibility affecting postdata statistical analysis. Here, we present a new analytical workflow MvM (missing value monitoring) able to recover quantitation of missing values generated by shotgun analysis. In particular, we used confident data-dependent acquisition (DDA) quantitation only for proteins measured in all the runs, while we filled the missing values with data-independent acquisition analysis using the library previously generated in DDA. We analyzed cell cycle regulated proteins, as they are low abundance proteins with highly dynamic expression levels. Indeed, we found that cell cycle related proteins are the major components of the missing values-rich proteome. Using the MvM workflow, we doubl...},

	Abstract = {Purple photosynthetic bacteria are capable of generating cellular energy from several sources, including photosynthesis, respiration, and H(2) oxidation. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, cellular energy can be used to assimilate carbon and nitrogen. This study provides the first evidence of a molecular link for the coregulation of nitrogenase and hydrogenase biosynthesis in an anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterium. We demonstrated that molybdenum nitrogenase biosynthesis is under the control of the RegB-RegA two-component regulatory system in Rhodobacter capsulatus. Footprint analyses and in vivo transcription studies showed that RegA indirectly activates nitrogenase synthesis by binding to and activating the expression of nifA2, which encodes one of the two functional copies of the nif-specific transcriptional activator, NifA. Expression of nifA2 but not nifA1 is reduced in the reg mutants up to eightfold under derepressing conditions and is also reduced under repressing conditions. Thus, although NtrC is absolutely required for nifA2 expression, RegA acts as a coactivator of nifA2. We also demonstrated that in reg mutants, [NiFe]hydrogenase synthesis and activity are increased up to sixfold. RegA binds to the promoter of the hydrogenase gene operon and therefore directly represses its expression. Thus, the RegB-RegA system controls such diverse processes as energy-generating photosynthesis and H(2) oxidation, as well as the energy-demanding processes of N(2) fixation and CO(2) assimilation.},

	Abstract = {The Bradyrhizobium japonicum fixRnifA operon is transcribed from two promoters: fixRp1, a -24/-12 promoter recognized by the sigma54-holoenzyme form of the RNA polymerase, and fixRp2, a -35/-10 promoter that is transcribed by a second, unidentified, form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The fixRp1 promoter is autoregulated during microaerobiosis by NifA, whereas fixRp2 is also activated, but by a different regulatory protein. The main transcription start sites for these promoters are just two nucleotides apart, such that the conserved -12 and -10 regions of fixRp1 and fixRp2, respectively, must overlap each other, whereas the -24 and -35 regions lie one DNA helical turn apart. Using in vivo genomic dimethyl sulfate and KMnO4 footprinting, we showed that the promoter region is differentially protected, depending upon which holoenzyme is bound. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that positions from -12 to -14 are critical for the activity of both promoters, whereas mutations at -10 and -11 affected mainly fixRp2 expression. When the sequence of the putative -35 region of fixRp2 was modified to match the putative consensus, expression from this promoter was increased 3-fold and the reactivity toward KMnO4, but not the transcriptional start site, moved two nucleotides further upstream, indicating that the altered promoter forms a different open complex. Additionally, we detected NifA-dependent methylation protection of two atypical NifA binding sites and protection of guanine -75. The latter residue is located in a region critical for fixRp2 promoter activation. The results present direct physical evidence of the complexity of the organization, regulation, and function of the fixRnifA promoter region.},

	Abstract = {Rhizobium sigma vegetative-dependent promoters are different from those of enteric bacteria and have never been characterized before. We report here the biochemical characterization of the ORF1-ntrBC promoter of Rhizobium etli. The minimal promoter region was located by means of a transcriptional fusion and further characterized by in vitro transcription and gel retardation experiments. Oligonucleotides used as DNA competitors in runoff transcription experiments allowed the precise localisation of the promoter region. Protein extracts from an ntrC+, but not from an ntrC- strain, inhibited in vitro transcription. The NtrC protein was found to bind specifically to the promoter, where an NtrC binding site overlapping the transcription initiation site, is present.},

	Abstract = {The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) locus has been consistently identified as a breast cancer risk locus in independent genome-wide association studies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FGFR2-mediated risk are still unknown. Using model systems we show that FGFR2-regulated genes are preferentially linked to breast cancer risk loci in expression quantitative trait loci analysis, supporting the concept that risk genes cluster in pathways. Using a network derived from 2,000 transcriptional profiles we identify SPDEF, ER$\alpha$, FOXA1, GATA3 and PTTG1 as master regulators of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling, and show that ER$\alpha$ occupancy responds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling. Our results indicate that ER$\alpha$, FOXA1 and GATA3 contribute to the regulation of breast cancer susceptibility genes, which is consistent with the effects of anti-oestrogen treatment in breast cancer prevention, and suggest that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling has an important role in mediating breast cancer risk.},

	Abstract = {We present GenoSuite, an integrated proteogenomic pipeline to validate, refine and discover protein coding genes using high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) data from prokaryotes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GenoSuite, we analyzed proteomics data of Bradyrhizobium japonicum (USDA110), a model organism to study agriculturally important rhizobium-legume symbiosis. Our analysis confirmed 31{\%} of known genes, refined 49 gene models for their translation initiation site (TIS) and discovered 59 novel protein coding genes. Notably, a novel protein which redefined the boundary of a crucial cytochrome P450 system related operon was discovered, known to be highly expressed in the anaerobic symbiotic bacteroids. A focused analysis on N-terminally acetylated peptides indicated downstream TIS for gene blr0594. Finally, ortho-proteogenomic analysis revealed three novel genes in recently sequenced B. japonicum USDA6(T) genome. The discovery of large number of missing genes and correction of gene models have expanded the proteomic landscape of B. japonicum and presents an unparalleled utility of proteogenomic analyses and versatility of GenoSuite for annotating prokaryotic genomes including pathogens.},

This effort, started in 1992, began with a fine-structure restriction map of an overlapping set of cosmids that covered the genome. Cosmid sequencing led to a gapped genome that was filled by primer walking on the chromosome and by using lambda clones. Methods had to be developed to handle strong stops in the high GC (68{\%}) inserts. Annotation was done with the ERGO system at Integrated Genomics, as was the reconstruction of the cell's metabolism. It was possible to recognize 3709 orfs of which functional assignments could be made with high confidence to 2392 (65{\%}). Unusual features include the presence of numerous cryptic phage genomes embedded in the chromosome.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a widely used technique in experiments where expression patterns of genes are to be profiled. Current stage technology allows the acquisition of profiles for a moderate number of genes (50 to a few thousand), and this number continues to grow. The use of appropriate normalization algorithms for qPCR-based data is therefore a highly important aspect of the data preprocessing pipeline.

RESULTS: We present and evaluate two data-driven normalization methods that directly correct for technical variation and represent robust alternatives to standard housekeeping gene-based approaches. We evaluated the performance of these methods against a single gene housekeeping gene method and our results suggest that quantile normalization performs best. These methods are implemented in freely-available software as an R package qpcrNorm distributed through the Bioconductor project.

CONCLUSION: The utility of the approaches that we describe can be demonstrated most clearly in situations where standard housekeeping genes are regulated by some experimental condition. For large qPCR-based data sets, our approaches represent robust, data-driven strategies for normalization.},

@article{Zhang:2013aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the biopharmaceutical industry, biomarkers define molecular taxonomies of patients and diseases and serve as surrogate endpoints in early-phase drug trials. Molecular biomarkers can be much more sensitive than traditional lab tests. Discriminating disease biomarkers by traditional method such as DNA microarray has proved challenging. Alternative splicing isoform represents a new class of diagnostic biomarkers. Recent scientific evidence is demonstrating that the differentiation and quantification of individual alternative splicing isoforms could improve insights into disease diagnosis and management. Identifying and characterizing alternative splicing isoforms are essential to the study of molecular mechanisms and early detection of complex diseases such as breast cancer. However, there are limitations with traditional methods used for alternative splicing isoform determination such as transcriptome-level, low level of coverage and poor focus on alternative splicing.

RESULTS: Therefore, we presented a peptidomics approach to searching novel alternative splicing isoforms in clinical proteomics. Our results showed that the approach has significant potential in enabling discovery of new types of high-quality alternative splicing isoform biomarkers.

CONCLUSIONS: We developed a peptidomics approach for the proteomics community to analyze, identify, and characterize alternative splicing isoforms from MS-based proteomics experiments with more coverage and exclusive focus on alternative splicing. The approach can help generate novel hypotheses on molecular risk factors and molecular mechanisms of cancer in early stage, leading to identification of potentially highly specific alternative splicing isoform biomarkers for early detection of cancer.},

@article{Starmer:2006aa,
	Abstract = {In prokaryotes, Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, nucleotides upstream from start codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are complementary to ribosomal RNA (rRNA), facilitate the initiation of protein synthesis. The location of SD sequences relative to start codons and the stability of the hybridization between the mRNA and the rRNA correlate with the rate of synthesis. Thus, accurate characterization of SD sequences enhances our understanding of how an organism's transcriptome relates to its cellular proteome. We implemented the Individual Nearest Neighbor Hydrogen Bond model for oligo-oligo hybridization and created a new metric, relative spacing (RS), to identify both the location and the hybridization potential of SD sequences by simulating the binding between mRNAs and single-stranded 16S rRNA 3' tails. In 18 prokaryote genomes, we identified 2,420 genes out of 58,550 where the strongest binding in the translation initiation region included the start codon, deviating from the expected location for the SD sequence of five to ten bases upstream. We designated these as RS+1 genes. Additional analysis uncovered an unusual bias of the start codon in that the majority of the RS+1 genes used GUG, not AUG. Furthermore, of the 624 RS+1 genes whose SD sequence was associated with a free energy release of less than -8.4 kcal/mol (strong RS+1 genes), 384 were within 12 nucleotides upstream of in-frame initiation codons. The most likely explanation for the unexpected location of the SD sequence for these 384 genes is mis-annotation of the start codon. In this way, the new RS metric provides an improved method for gene sequence annotation. The remaining strong RS+1 genes appear to have their SD sequences in an unexpected location that includes the start codon. Thus, our RS metric provides a new way to explore the role of rRNA-mRNA nucleotide hybridization in translation initiation.},

@article{Jeong2000,
	Abstract = {In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, a putative membrane-bound complex encoded by the rnfABCDGEH operon is thought to be dedicated to electron transport to nitrogenase. In this study, the whole rnf operon was cloned under the control of the nifH promoter in plasmid pNR117 and expressed in several rnf mutants. Complementation analysis demonstrated that transconjugants which integrated plasmid pNR117 directed effective biosynthesis of a functionally competent complex in R. capsulatus. Moreover, it was found that strains carrying pNR117 displayed nitrogenase activities 50 to 100{\%} higher than the wild-type level. The results of radioactive labeling experiments indicated that the intracellular content of nitrogenase polypeptides was marginally altered in strains containing pNR117, whereas the levels of the RnfB and RnfC proteins present in the membrane were four- and twofold, respectively, higher than the wild-type level. Hence, the enhancement of in vivo nitrogenase activity was correlated with a commensurate overproduction of the Rnf polypeptides. In vitro nitrogenase assays performed in the presence of an artificial electron donor indicated that the catalytic activity of the enzyme was not increased in strains overproducing the Rnf polypeptides. It is proposed that the supply of reductants through the Rnf complex might be rate limiting for nitrogenase activity in vivo. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed on solubilized membrane proteins revealed that RnfB and RnfC are associated with each other and with additional polypeptides which may be components of the membrane-bound complex.},

There is extensive conservation of C-terminal regions between products of RP501 ntrB; Klebsiella pneumoniae ntrB; Escherichia coli envZ, cpxA, and phoR; Agrobacterium tumefaciens virA; and, to a lesser extent, E. coli cheA. There is also extensive conservation of N-terminal regions between products of RP501 ntrC; K. pneumoniae ntrC; E. coli ompR, sfrA, phoB, cheY and cheB; Salmonella typhimurium cheB and cheY; Bacillus subtilis spoOA and spoOF; and A. tumefaciens virG. We propose that these regulatory genes comprise two-component regulatory systems that evolved from a common ancestral system that involved transduction of information about the status of the environment by one protein domain (the C-terminal regions conserved among ntrB, envZ, etc.) to a second one (the N-terminal region conserved among ntrC, ompR, etc.). The ntrC-set protein then acts upon a specific responding mechanism, typically as a transcriptional activator but also as an effector of the maturation of outer membrane proteins or as a modulator of the direction of flagella rotation.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, our understanding of biological nitrogen fixation has been bolstered by a diverse array of scientific techniques. Still, the origin and extant distribution of nitrogen fixation has been perplexing from a phylogenetic perspective, largely because of factors that confound molecular phylogeny such as sequence divergence, paralogy, and horizontal gene transfer. Here, we make use of 110 publicly available complete genome sequences to understand how the core components of nitrogenase, including NifH, NifD, NifK, NifE, and NifN proteins, have evolved. These genes are universal in nitrogen fixing organisms-typically found within highly conserved operons-and, overall, have remarkably congruent phylogenetic histories. Additional clues to the early origins of this system are available from two distinct clades of nitrogenase paralogs: a group composed of genes essential to photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and a group of uncharacterized genes present in methanogens and in some photosynthetic bacteria. We explore the complex genetic history of the nitrogenase family, which is replete with gene duplication, recruitment, fusion, and horizontal gene transfer and discuss these events in light of the hypothesized presence of nitrogenase in the last common ancestor of modern organisms, as well as the additional possibility that nitrogen fixation might have evolved later, perhaps in methanogenic archaea, and was subsequently transferred into the bacterial domain.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracting motifs from sequences is a mainstay of bioinformatics. We look at the problem of mining structured motifs, which allow variable length gaps between simple motif components. We propose an efficient algorithm, called EXMOTIF, that given some sequence(s), and a structured motif template, extracts all frequent structured motifs that have quorum q. Potential applications of our method include the extraction of single/composite regulatory binding sites in DNA sequences.

RESULTS: EXMOTIF is efficient in terms of both time and space and is shown empirically to outperform RISO, a state-of-the-art algorithm. It is also successful in finding potential single/composite transcription factor binding sites.

CONCLUSION: EXMOTIF is a useful and efficient tool in discovering structured motifs, especially in DNA sequences. The algorithm is available as open-source at: http://www.cs.rpi.edu/{\~{}}zaki/software/exMotif/.},

	Abstract = {Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAl 5 is of agricultural significance due to its ability to provide fixed nitrogen to plants. Consequently, its genome sequence has been eagerly anticipated to enhance understanding of endophytic nitrogen fixation. Two groups have sequenced the PAl 5 genome from the same source (ATCC 49037), though the resulting sequences contain a surprisingly high number of differences. Therefore, an optical map of PAl 5 was constructed in order to determine which genome assembly more closely resembles the chromosomal DNA by aligning each sequence against a physical map of the genome. While one sequence aligned very well, over 98{\%} of the second sequence contained numerous rearrangements. The many differences observed between these two genome sequences could be owing to either assembly errors or rapid evolutionary divergence. The extent of the differences derived from sequence assembly errors could be assessed if the raw sequencing reads were provided by both genome centers at the time of genome sequence submission. Hence, a new genome sequence standard is proposed whereby the investigator supplies the raw reads along with the closed sequence so that the community can make more accurate judgments on whether differences observed in a single stain may be of biological origin or are simply caused by differences in genome assembly procedures.},

@article{Schwientek2014,
	Abstract = {Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 is the producer of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, which is an economically relevant and potent drug in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we present the detection of transcription start sites on this genome by sequencing enriched 5'-ends of primary transcripts. Altogether, 1427 putative transcription start sites were initially identified. With help of the annotated genome sequence, 661 transcription start sites were found to belong to the leader region of protein-coding genes with the surprising result that roughly 20{\%} of these genes rank among the class of leaderless transcripts. Next, conserved promoter motifs were identified for protein-coding genes with and without leader sequences. The mapped transcription start sites were finally used to improve the annotation of the Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 genome sequence. Concerning protein-coding genes, 41 translation start sites were corrected and 9 novel protein-coding genes could be identified. In addition to this, 122 previously undetermined non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 were defined. Focusing on antisense transcription start sites located within coding genes or their leader sequences, it was discovered that 96 of those ncRNA genes belong to the class of antisense RNA (asRNA) genes. The remaining 26 ncRNA genes were found outside of known protein-coding genes. Four chosen examples of prominent ncRNA genes, namely the transfer messenger RNA gene ssrA, the ribonuclease P class A RNA gene rnpB, the cobalamin riboswitch RNA gene cobRS, and the selenocysteine-specific tRNA gene selC, are presented in more detail. This study demonstrates that sequencing of enriched 5'-ends of primary transcripts and the identification of transcription start sites are valuable tools for advanced genome annotation of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 and most probably also for other bacteria.},

	Abstract = {During the process of transcription, RNA polymerase can exactly locate a promoter sequence in the complex maze of a genome. Several experimental studies and computational analyses have shown that the promoter sequences apparently possess some special properties, such as unusual DNA structures and low stability, which make them distinct from the rest of the genome. But most of these studies have been carried out on a particular set of promoter sequences or on promoter sequences from similar organisms. To examine whether the promoters from a wide variety of organisms share these special properties, we have carried out an analysis of sets of promoters from bacteria, vertebrates and plants. These promoters were analyzed with respect to the prediction of three different properties, such as DNA curvature, bendability and stability, which are relevant to transcription. All the promoter sequences are predicted to share certain features, such as stability and bendability profiles, but there are significant differences in DNA curvature profiles and nucleotide composition between the different organisms. These similarities and differences are correlated with some of the known facts about transcription process in the promoters from the three groups of organisms.},

	Abstract = {Proteins from the supernatant of Bradyrhizobium japonicum were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie. This revealed more than 100 protein spots. Sixty-eight proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Thirty-five are predicted to contain an N-terminal signal peptide characteristic for proteins transported by the general secretory pathway. Most of these appear to be substrate-binding proteins of the ABC transporter family. Ten proteins were categorized as unclassified conserved or hypothetical. None of the proteins has similarity to proteins transported by a type I secretion system or to autotransporters. Three of the proteins might be located in the outer membrane. The addition of genistein led to changes in the spot pattern of three flagellar proteins and resulted in the identification of the nodulation outer protein Pgl. Moreover, the application of shot-gun mass spectrometry resulted in the first-time identification of NopB, NopH and NopT, which were present only after genistein induction. Replacing genistein with daidzein or coumestrol reduced the amount of the type III-secreted protein GunA2.},

	Abstract = {Transcription initiation is a key event in the regulation of gene expression. RNA polymerase (RNAP), the central enzyme of transcription, is able to efficiently locate promoters in the genome, carry out promoter opening, and initiate RNA synthesis. All the substeps of transcription initiation are subject to complex cellular regulation. Understanding the molecular details of each step in the promoter-opening pathway is essential for a complete mechanistic and quantitative picture of gene expression. In this minireview, primarily using bacterial RNAP as an example, I briefly summarize some of the key recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of promoter search and promoter opening.},

@article{Kim1996,
	Abstract = {The Azotobacter vinelandii nifW gene, under control of the nifH promoter, was subcloned into the broad host range multicopy plasmid pKT230 for overexpression in both wild-type and delta nifW strains of A. vinelandii. Unlike the parent delta nifW strain, which grows slowly relative to wild-type under N2-fixing conditions, both overproduction strains grow at the same rate, showing that the overexpressed nifW product is functional in vivo. The approximately 40-fold overexpressed protein was purified, and sequence analysis confirmed its identity. During purification it was observed that NifW in crude extracts ran above the predicted molecular weight on denaturing gels and that as the purification proceeded lower molecular weight forms appeared. Mass spectrometry and studies with protease inhibitors revealed that this abnormal behavior was due to proteolysis. Native molecular weight determinations demonstrate that NifW is a homomultimer, most likely a trimer. Native gel electrophoresis analysis shows that the behavior of wild-type and overexpressed NifW are identical and that when extracts are prepared anaerobically only the homomultimeric forms of NifW are observed. When extracts are exposed to oxygen, however, NifW becomes part of a very high molecular weight complex. Immunoprecipitation with NifW antibodies demonstrate that under those conditions NifW specifically associates with the MoFe protein. These data are consistent with a model whereby NifW is not involved in the initial assembly of an active MoFe protein but rather is part of a system design to protect the MoFe protein from O2 damage.},

	Abstract = {Gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are two events that enable the generation of new genes. Rhodobacter sphaeroides (WS8 and 2.4.1 strains) has four copies of the rpoN gene that are not functionally interchangeable. Until now, this is the only example of specialization of this sigma factor. In this work, we aimed to determine whether the multiple copies of this gene originated from HGT or through gene duplication. Our results suggest a multiplication origin of the different rpoN copies that occurred after the Rhodobacter clade separated. Functional tests indicate that the specialization of the rpoN genes is not restricted to R. sphaeroides. We propose that the rpoN copy involved in nitrogen fixation is the ancestral gene and that the other rpoN genes have acquired new specificities.},

@article{Iglesias-Gomez:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Meningiomas are frequent central nervous system neoplasms, which despite their predominant benignity, show sporadically malignant behavior. Type 2 neurofibromatosis and polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with meningioma risk and are probably involved in its pathogenesis. Although GWAS studies have found loci related to meningioma risk, little is known about the factors determining malignant transformation. Thus, this study is aimed to identify the genomic and transcriptomic factors influencing evolution from benignity toward aggressive phenotypes. By applying an integrative bioinformatics pipeline combining public information on a wealth of biological layers of complexity (from genetic polymorphisms to protein interactions), this study identified a module of co-expressed genes highly correlated with tumor stage and statistically linked to several genomic regions (module Quantitative Trait Loci, mQTLs). Ontology analysis of the transcription hub genes identified microtubule-associated cell-cycle processes as key drivers of such network. mQTLs and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with meningioma stage were replicated in an alternative meningioma cohort, and integration of these results with up-to-date scientific literature and several databases retrieved a list of genes and pathways with a potentially important role in meningioma malignancy. As a result, cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion pathways, calcium-channels and glutamate receptors, as well as oxidoreductase and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathways were found to be the most important and redundant findings associated to meningioma progression. This study presents an integrated view of the pathways involved in meningioma malignant conversion and paves the way for the development of new research lines that will improve our understanding of meningioma biology.},

	Abstract = {The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the field of genomics, enabling fast and cost-effective generation of genome-scale sequence data with exquisite resolution and accuracy. Over the past years, rapid technological advances led by academic institutions and companies have continued to broaden NGS applications from research to the clinic. A recent crop of discoveries have highlighted the medical impact of NGS technologies on Mendelian and complex diseases, particularly cancer. However, the ever-increasing pace of NGS adoption presents enormous challenges in terms of data processing, storage, management and interpretation as well as sequencing quality control, which hinder the translation from sequence data into clinical practice. In this review, we first summarize the technical characteristics and performance of current NGS platforms. We further highlight advances in the applications of NGS technologies towards the development of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Common issues in NGS workflows are also discussed to guide the selection of NGS platforms and pipelines for specific research purposes.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In silico comparative genomics approaches have been efficiently used for functional prediction and reconstruction of metabolic and regulatory networks. Riboswitches are metabolite-sensing structures often found in bacterial mRNA leaders controlling gene expression on transcriptional or translational levels.An increasing number of riboswitches and other cis-regulatory RNAs have been recently classified into numerous RNA families in the Rfam database. High conservation of these RNA motifs provides a unique advantage for their genomic identification and comparative analysis.

RESULTS: A comparative genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict tool was used for reconstruction and functional annotation of regulons controlled by RNAs from 43 Rfam families in diverse taxonomic groups of Bacteria. The inferred regulons include {\~{}}5200 cis-regulatory RNAs and more than 12000 target genes in 255 microbial genomes. All predicted RNA-regulated genes were classified into specific and overall functional categories. Analysis of taxonomic distribution of these categories allowed us to establish major functional preferences for each analyzed cis-regulatory RNA motif family. Overall, most RNA motif regulons showed predictable functional content in accordance with their experimentally established effector ligands. Our results suggest that some RNA motifs (including thiamin pyrophosphate and cobalamin riboswitches that control the cofactor metabolism) are widespread and likely originated from the last common ancestor of all bacteria. However, many more analyzed RNA motifs are restricted to a narrow taxonomic group of bacteria and likely represent more recent evolutionary innovations.

CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed regulatory networks for major known RNA motifs substantially expand the existing knowledge of transcriptional regulation in bacteria. The inferred regulons can be used for genetic experiments, functional annotations of genes, metabolic reconstruction and evolutionary analysis. The obtained genome-wide collection of reference RNA motif regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/).},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score. RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53{\%}) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

	Abstract = {Alphaproteobacteria show a great versatility in adapting to a broad range of environments and lifestyles, with the association between bacteria and plants as one of the most intriguing, spanning from relatively unspecific nonsymbiotic association (as rhizospheric or endophytic strains) to the highly species-specific interaction of rhizobia. To shed some light on possible common genetic features in such a heterogeneous set of plant associations, the genomes of 92 Alphaproteobacteria strains were analyzed with a fuzzy orthologs-species detection approach. This showed that the different habitats and lifestyles of plant-associated bacteria (soil, plant colonizers, symbiont) are partially reflected by the trend to have larger genomes with respect to nonplant-associated species. A relatively large set of genes specific to symbiotic bacteria (73 orthologous groups) was found, with a remarkable presence of regulators, sugar transporters, metabolic enzymes, nodulation genes and several genes with unknown function that could be good candidates for further characterization. Interestingly, 15 orthologous groupspresent in all plant-associated bacteria (symbiotic and nonsymbiotic), but absent in nonplant-associated bacteria, were also found, whose functions were mainly related to regulation of gene expression and electron transport. Two of these orthologous groups were also detected in fully sequenced 
plant-associated Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Overall these results lead us to hypothesize that plant-bacteria associations, though quite variable, are partially supported by a conserved set of unsuspected gene functions.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated how gene expression differs in mature Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms as opposed to planktonic cells by the use of RNA sequencing technology that gives rise to both quantitative and qualitative information on the transcriptome. Although a large proportion of genes were consistently regulated in both the stationary phase and biofilm cultures as opposed to the late exponential growth phase cultures, the global biofilm gene expression pattern was clearly distinct indicating that biofilms are not just surface attached cells in stationary phase. A large amount of the genes found to be biofilm specific were involved in adaptation to microaerophilic growth conditions, repression of type three secretion and production of extracellular matrix components. Additionally, we found many small RNAs to be differentially regulated most of them similarly in stationary phase cultures and biofilms. A qualitative analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed more than 3000 putative transcriptional start sites (TSS). By the use of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) we confirmed the presence of three different TSS associated with the pqsABCDE operon, two in the promoter of pqsA and one upstream of the second gene, pqsB. Taken together, this study reports the first transcriptome study on P. aeruginosa that employs RNA sequencing technology and provides insights into the quantitative and qualitative transcriptome including the expression of small RNAs in P. aeruginosa biofilms.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gamma-proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli, can use a variety of respiratory substrates employing numerous aerobic and anaerobic respiratory systems controlled by multiple transcription regulators. Thus, in E. coli, global control of respiration is mediated by four transcription factors, Fnr, ArcA, NarL and NarP. However, in other Gamma-proteobacteria the composition of global respiration regulators may be different. RESULTS: In this study we applied a comparative genomic approach to the analysis of three global regulatory systems, Fnr, ArcA and NarP. These systems were studied in available genomes containing these three regulators, but lacking NarL. So, we considered several representatives of Pasteurellaceae, Vibrionaceae and Yersinia spp. As a result, we identified new regulon members, functioning in respiration, central metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cicle, metabolism of pyruvate and lactate), metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids, transcriptional regulation and transport, in particular: the ATP synthase operon atpIBEFHAGCD, Na+-exporting NADH dehydrogenase operon nqrABCDEF, the D-amino acids dehydrogenase operon dadAX. Using an extension of the comparative technique, we demonstrated taxon-specific changes in regulatory interactions and predicted taxon-specific regulatory cascades. CONCLUSION: A comparative genomic technique was applied to the analysis of global regulation of respiration in ten gamma-proteobacterial genomes. Three structurally different but functionally related regulatory systems were described. A correlation between the regulon size and the position of a transcription factor in regulatory cascades was observed: regulators with larger regulons tend to occupy top positions in the cascades.

	Abstract = {In Mycobacterium tuberculosis the alternative sigma factor SigF controls the expression of a particular subset of genes by altering RNA polymerase specificity. Here, we utilize two genome-wide approaches to identify SigF-binding sites: chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-on-chip) and microarray analysis of SigF-mediated transcripts. Since SigF is not an abundant protein in the logarithmic phase of growth, a pristinamyin IA-inducible system was used to control its expression. We identified 67 high-affinity SigF-binding sites and 16 loci where a SigF promoter directs the expression of a transcript. These loci include sigF itself, genes involved in lipid and intermediary metabolism and virulence, and at least one transcriptional regulator (Rv2884), possibly acting downstream of SigF. In addition, SigF was also found to direct the transcription of the gene for small RNA F6. Many loci were also found where SigF may be involved in antisense transcription, and in two cases (Rv1358 and Rv1870c) the SigF-dependent promoter was located within the predicted coding sequence. Quantitative PCR confirmed the microarray findings and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to map the SigF-specific transcriptional start points. A canonical SigF consensus promoter sequence GGTTT-N((15-17))-GGGTA was found prior to 11 genes. Together, these data help to define the SigF regulon and show that SigF not only governs expression of proteins such as the virulence factor, HbhA, but also impacts novel functions, such as noncoding RNAs and antisense transcripts.},

	Abstract = {Ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductases (FNRs) constitute a family of flavoenzymes that catalyse the exchange of electrons between ferredoxin and NADP(H). In cyanobacteria FNR provides NADPH for photoautotrophic metabolism, but the enzyme is also capable of oxidizing NADPH providing reduced ferredoxin. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, the unique petH gene has two translation products depending on growth conditions. As a consequence two isoforms of the FNR accumulate - FNR(L) and FNR(S) . In the present work, analysis of petH expression reveals that different transcriptional start points (tsp) are responsible for this differential translation initiation. Under standard conditions (where FNR(L) accumulates), two tsps were found at -52 and -34 relative to the first translation start site. Under nitrogen-starvation conditions (where FNR(S) accumulates) a tsp was mapped at -126 relative to the first translation start site. Therefore, the transcript responsible for FNR(S) translation is longer than that producing FNR(L) . In addition, expression of the short or long transcript in E. coli resulted in the accumulation of FNR(L) or FNR(S) respectively. This result demonstrates that translation can initiate at two different sites, 336-bases apart (ATG-1 to ATG-113), depending only on the 5'UTR structure.},

	Abstract = {Recent genome sequencing studies have shown that the somatic mutations that drive cancer development are distributed across a large number of genes. This mutational heterogeneity complicates efforts to distinguish functional mutations from sporadic, passenger mutations. Since cancer mutations are hypothesized to target a relatively small number of cellular signaling and regulatory pathways, a common practice is to assess whether known pathways are enriched for mutated genes. We introduce an alternative approach that examines mutated genes in the context of a genome-scale gene interaction network. We present a computationally efficient strategy for de novo identification of subnetworks in an interaction network that are mutated in a statistically significant number of patients. This framework includes two major components. First, we use a diffusion process on the interaction network to define a local neighborhood of "influence" for each mutated gene in the network. Second, we derive a two-stage multiple hypothesis test to bound the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with the identified subnetworks. We test these algorithms on a large human protein-protein interaction network using somatic mutation data from glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma samples. We successfully recover pathways that are known to be important in these cancers and also identify additional pathways that have been implicated in other cancers but not previously reported as mutated in these samples. We anticipate that our approach will find increasing use as cancer genome studies increase in size and scope.},

	Abstract = {Sequence analysis of the rpoN (2)- fixA intergenic region in the genome of Rhizobium etli CNPAF512 has uncovered three genes involved in nitrogen fixation, namely nifU, nifS and nifW. These genes are preceded by an ORF that is highly conserved among nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It encodes a putative gene product of 105 amino acids, belonging to the HesB-like protein family. A phylogenetic analysis of members of the HesB-like protein family showed that the R. etli HesB-like protein clusters with polypeptides encoded by ORFs situated upstream of the nifUS nitrogen fixation regions in the genomes of other diazotrophs. The R. etli ORF that encodes the HesB-like protein was designated iscN. iscN is co-transcribed with nifU and nifS, and is preferentially expressed under free-living microaerobic conditions and in bacteroids. Expression is regulated by the alternative sigma factor RpoN and the enchancer-binding protein NifA. A R. etli iscN mutant displays a reduction in nitrogen fixation capacity of 90{\%} compared to the wild-type strain. This Nif(-) phenotype could be complemented by the introduction of intact copies of R. etli iscN.},

@article{Spicer:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We have developed a sequence-specific model for predicting slopes (S) in the fundamental equation of linear solvent strength theory for the reversed-phase HPLC separation of tryptic peptides detected in a typical bottom-up-proteomics experiment. These slopes control the variation in the separation selectivity observed when the physical parameters of chromatographic separation, such as gradient slope, flow rate, and column size are altered. For example, with the use of an arbitrarily chosen set of tryptic peptides with a 4-times difference in the gradient slope between two experiments, the R(2)-value of correlation between the observed retention times of identical species decreases to {\~{}}0.993-0.996 (compared to a theoretical value of {\~{}}1.00). The observed retention time shifts associated with variations of the gradient slope can be predicted a priori using the approach described here. The proposed model is based on our findings for a set of synthetic species (Vu, H.; Spicer, V.; Gotfrid, A.; Krokhin, O. V. J. Chromatogr., A, 2010, 1217, 489-497), which postulate that slopes S can be predicted taking into account simultaneously peptide length, charge, and hydrophobicity. Here we extend this approach using an extensive set of real tryptic peptides. We developed the procedure to accurately measure S-values in nano-RP HPLC MS experiments and introduced sequence-specific corrections for a more accurate prediction of the slopes S. A correlation of {\~{}}0.95 R(2)-value between the predicted and experimental S-values was demonstrated. Predicting S-values and calculating the expected retention time shifts when the physical parameters of separation like gradient slope are altered will facilitate a more accurate application of peptide retention prediction protocols, aid in the transfer of scheduled MRM (SRM) procedures between LC systems, and increase the efficiency of interlaboratory data collection and comparison.},

	Abstract = {Nothing is currently known regarding the global regulatory networks of Treponema denticola and other oral spirochetes. In this report, we assess the properties and potential phosphotransfer capability of a putative two-component regulatory system (TCS) of T. denticola that is formed by the products of open reading frames tde0032 (a sensor kinase) and tde0033 (a response regulator), henceforth designated AtcS and AtcR, respectively. Using PCR and DNA sequence analyses, atcS and atcR were demonstrated to be widely distributed and conserved among T. denticola isolates. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that these genes are cotranscribed and may also be expressed as part of a larger operon that includes several flanking genes. Analyses using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends identified the transcriptional start sites for these operons and provided evidence that some of these genes may be independently transcribed from internal promoters. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed significant upregulation of atcRS during late-stage growth, indicating growth-phase-dependent expression. Lastly, the phosphorelay capability of the AtcRS system was assessed and demonstrated using recombinant proteins. AtcS was found to undergo autophosphorylation and to transfer phosphate to AtcR. These analyses represent the first description of a functional TCS in an oral spirochetes and provide insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of these important bacteria.},

	Abstract = {Bacterial enhancer binding proteins (bEBPs) are transcriptional activators that assemble as hexameric rings in their active forms and utilize ATP hydrolysis to remodel the conformation of RNA polymerase containing the alternative sigma factor $\sigma$(54). We present a comprehensive and detailed summary of recent advances in our understanding of how these specialized molecular machines function. The review is structured by introducing each of the three domains in turn: the central catalytic domain, the N-terminal regulatory domain, and the C-terminal DNA binding domain. The role of the central catalytic domain is presented with particular reference to (i) oligomerization, (ii) ATP hydrolysis, and (iii) the key GAFTGA motif that contacts $\sigma$(54) for remodeling. Each of these functions forms a potential target of the signal-sensing N-terminal regulatory domain, which can act either positively or negatively to control the activation of $\sigma$(54)-dependent transcription. Finally, we focus on the DNA binding function of the C-terminal domain and the enhancer sites to which it binds. Particular attention is paid to the importance of $\sigma$(54) to the bacterial cell and its unique role in regulating transcription.},

DNase I footprint analyses indicated that R. sphaeroides CbbR binds to the cbb(I) promoter between -10 and -70 base pairs (bp) relative to the cbb(I) transcription start. A cosmid carrying the R. capsulatus reg locus was capable of complementing an R. sphaeroides regA-deficient mutant to phototrophic growth with restored regulated synthesis of both photopigments and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). DNase I footprint analyses, using R. capsulatus RegA*, a constitutively active mutant version of RegA, detected four RegA* binding sites within the cbb(I) promoter. Two sites were found within a previously identified cbb(I) promoter proximal regulatory region from -61 to -110 bp. One of these proximal RegA* binding sites overlapped that of CbbR. Two sites were within a previously identified promoter distal positive regulatory region between -301 and -415 bp. Expression from promoter insertion mutants showed that the function of the promoter distal regulatory region was helical phase-dependent. These results indicated that RegA exerts its regulatory affect on cbb(I) expression through direct interaction with the cbb(I) promoter.},

@article{Sahr2012,
	Abstract = {The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is found ubiquitously in aquatic environments and can cause a severe pneumonia in humans called Legionnaires' disease. How this bacterium switches from intracellular to extracellular life and adapts to different hosts and environmental conditions is only partly understood. Here we used RNA deep sequencing from exponentially (replicative) and post exponentially (virulent) grown L. pneumophila to analyze the transcriptional landscape of its entire genome. We established the complete operon map and defined 2561 primary transcriptional start sites (TSS). Interestingly, 187 of the 1805 TSS of protein-coding genes contained tandem promoters of which 93 show alternative usage dependent on the growth phase. Similarly, over 60{\%} of 713 here identified ncRNAs are phase dependently regulated. Analysis of their conservation among the seven L. pneumophila genomes sequenced revealed many strain specific differences suggesting that L. pneumophila contains a highly dynamic pool of ncRNAs. Analysis of six ncRNAs exhibiting the same expression pattern as virulence genes showed that two, Lppnc0584 and Lppnc0405 are indeed involved in intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in A. castellanii. Furthermore, L. pneumophila encodes a small RNA named RsmX that functions together with RsmY and RsmZ in the LetA-CsrA regulatory pathway, crucial for the switch to the virulent phenotype. Together our data provide new insight into the transcriptional organization of the L. pneumophila genome, identified many new ncRNAs and will provide a framework for the understanding of virulence and adaptation properties of L. pneumophila.},

	Abstract = {The fixation of atmospheric N(2) by cyanobacteria is a major source of nitrogen in the biosphere. In Nostocales, such as Anabaena, this process is spatially separated from oxygenic photosynthesis and occurs in heterocysts. Upon nitrogen step-down, these specialized cells differentiate from vegetative cells in a process controlled by two major regulators: NtcA and HetR. However, the regulon controlled by these two factors is only partially defined, and several aspects of the differentiation process have remained enigmatic. Using differential RNA-seq, we experimentally define a genome-wide map of {\textgreater}10,000 transcriptional start sites (TSS) of Anabaena sp. PCC7120, a model organism for the study of prokaryotic cell differentiation and N(2) fixation. By analyzing the adaptation to nitrogen stress, our global TSS map provides insight into the dynamic changes that modify the transcriptional organization at a critical step of the differentiation process. We identify {\textgreater}900 TSS with minimum fold change in response to nitrogen deficiency of eight. From these TSS, at least 209 were under control of HetR, whereas at least 158 other TSS were potentially directly controlled by NtcA. Our analysis of the promoters activated during the switch to N(2) fixation adds hundreds of protein-coding genes and noncoding transcripts to the list of potentially involved factors. These data experimentally define the NtcA regulon and the DIF(+) motif, a palindrome at or close to position -35 that seems essential for heterocyst-specific expression of certain genes.},

Previous results suggested that the response to the nitrogen status is mediated by the two-component NtrB/NtrC system which controls transcription of the nodD3 gene, encoding a positive regulatory protein for the activation of nodABC transcription. Here we confirm by DNase I footprinting and gel shift assays that NtrC, when phosphorylated by NtrB, is able to interact with the enhancer sequences present upstream of nodD3. A model is proposed whereby NtrC functions to control the transcription from the two promoters in the upstream region of nodD3 in response to nitrogen status.},

	Abstract = {Shotgun proteomics entails the identification of as many peptides as possible from complex mixtures. Here we investigate how many peptides are detectable by high resolution MS in standard LC runs of cell lysate and how many of them are accessible to data-dependent MS/MS. Isotope clusters were determined by MaxQuant and stringently filtered for charge states and retention times typical of peptides. This resulted in more than 100,000 likely peptide features, of which only about 16{\%} had been targeted for MS/MS. Three instrumental attributes determine the proportion of additional peptides that can be identified: sequencing speed, sensitivity, and precursor ion isolation. In our data, an MS/MS scan rate of 25/s would be necessary to target all peptide features, but this drops to less than 17/s for reasonably abundant peptides. Sensitivity is a greater challenge, with many peptide features requiring long MS/MS injection times ({\textgreater}250 ms). The greatest limitation, however, is the generally low proportion of the target peptide ion intensity in the MS/MS selection window (the "precursor ion fraction" or PIF). Median PIF is only 0.14, making the peptides difficult to identify by standard MS/MS methods. Our results aid in developing strategies to further increase coverage in shotgun proteomics.},

	Abstract = {A statistical model is presented for computing probabilities that proteins are present in a sample on the basis of peptides assigned to tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra acquired from a proteolytic digest of the sample. Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.},

@article{Sittka2008,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput pyrosequencing (HTPS) technology now allow a thorough analysis of RNA bound to cellular proteins, and, therefore, of post-transcriptional regulons. We used HTPS to discover the Salmonella RNAs that are targeted by the common bacterial Sm-like protein, Hfq. Initial transcriptomic analysis revealed that Hfq controls the expression of almost a fifth of all Salmonella genes, including several horizontally acquired pathogenicity islands (SPI-1, -2, - 4, -5), two sigma factor regulons, and the flagellar gene cascade. Subsequent HTPS analysis of 350,000 cDNAs, derived from RNA co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) with epitope-tagged Hfq or control coIP, identified 727 mRNAs that are Hfq-bound in vivo. The cDNA analysis discovered new, small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) and more than doubled the number of sRNAs known to be expressed in Salmonella to 64; about half of these are associated with Hfq. Our analysis explained aspects of the pleiotropic effects of Hfq loss-of-function. Specifically, we found that the mRNAs of hilD (master regulator of the SPI-1 invasion genes) and flhDC (flagellar master regulator) were bound by Hfq. We predicted that defective SPI-1 secretion and flagellar phenotypes of the hfq mutant would be rescued by overexpression of HilD and FlhDC, and we proved this to be correct. The combination of epitope-tagging and HTPS of immunoprecipitated RNA detected the expression of many intergenic chromosomal regions of Salmonella. Our approach overcomes the limited availability of high-density microarrays that have impeded expression-based sRNA discovery in microorganisms. We present a generic strategy that is ideal for the systems-level analysis of the post-transcriptional regulons of RNA-binding proteins and for sRNA discovery in a wide range of bacteria.},

@article{Albrecht2011,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene function analysis of the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae is hampered by the facts that this organism is inaccessible to genetic manipulations and not cultivable outside the host. The genomes of several strains have been sequenced; however, very little information is available on the gene structure and transcriptome of C. pneumoniae.

RESULTS: Using a differential RNA-sequencing approach with specific enrichment of primary transcripts, we defined the transcriptome of purified elementary bodies and reticulate bodies of C. pneumoniae strain CWL-029; 565 transcriptional start sites of annotated genes and novel transcripts were mapped. Analysis of adjacent genes for co-transcription revealed 246 polycistronic transcripts. In total, a distinct transcription start site or an affiliation to an operon could be assigned to 862 out of 1,074 annotated protein coding genes. Semi-quantitative analysis of mapped cDNA reads revealed significant differences for 288 genes in the RNA levels of genes isolated from elementary bodies and reticulate bodies. We have identified and in part confirmed 75 novel putative non-coding RNAs. The detailed map of transcription start sites at single nucleotide resolution allowed for the first time a comprehensive and saturating analysis of promoter consensus sequences in Chlamydia.

CONCLUSIONS: The precise transcriptional landscape as a complement to the genome sequence will provide new insights into the organization, control and function of genes. Novel non-coding RNAs and identified common promoter motifs will help to understand gene regulation of this important human pathogen.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In prokaryotes, sigma factors are essential for directing the transcription machinery towards promoters. Various sigma factors have been described that recognize, and bind to specific DNA sequence motifs in promoter sequences. The canonical sigma factor $\sigma$(70) is commonly involved in transcription of the cell's housekeeping genes, which is mediated by the conserved $\sigma$(70) promoter sequence motifs. In this study the $\sigma$(70)-promoter sequences in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 were predicted using a genome-wide analysis. The accuracy of the transcriptionally-active part of this promoter prediction was subsequently evaluated by correlating locations of predicted promoters with transcription start sites inferred from the 5'-ends of transcripts detected by high-resolution tiling array transcriptome datasets.

RESULTS: To identify $\sigma$(70)-related promoter sequences, we performed a genome-wide sequence motif scan of the L. plantarum WCFS1 genome focussing on the regions upstream of protein-encoding genes. We obtained several highly conserved motifs including those resembling the conserved $\sigma$(70)-promoter consensus. Position weight matrices-based models of the recovered $\sigma$(70)-promoter sequence motif were employed to identify 3874 motifs with significant similarity (p-value{\textless}10(-4)) to the model-motif in the L. plantarum genome. Genome-wide transcript information deduced from whole genome tiling-array transcriptome datasets, was used to infer transcription start sites (TSSs) from the 5'-end of transcripts. By this procedure, 1167 putative TSSs were identified that were used to corroborate the transcriptionally active fraction of these predicted promoters. In total, 568 predicted promoters were found in proximity (≤ 40 nucleotides) of the putative TSSs, showing a highly significant co-occurrence of predicted promoter and TSS (p-value{\textless}10(-263)).

CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution tiling arrays provide a suitable source to infer TSSs at a genome-wide level, and allow experimental verification of in silico predicted promoter sequence motifs.},

	Abstract = {Homocitrate is a component of the iron-molybdenum cofactor in nitrogenase, where nitrogen fixation occurs. NifV, which encodes homocitrate synthase (HCS), has been identified from various diazotrophs but is not present in most rhizobial species that perform efficient nitrogen fixation only in symbiotic association with legumes. Here we show that the FEN1 gene of a model legume, Lotus japonicus, overcomes the lack of NifV in rhizobia for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. A Fix(-) (non-fixing) plant mutant, fen1, forms morphologically normal but ineffective nodules. The causal gene, FEN1, was shown to encode HCS by its ability to complement a HCS-defective mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homocitrate was present abundantly in wild-type nodules but was absent from ineffective fen1 nodules. Inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti carrying FEN1 or Azotobacter vinelandii NifV rescued the defect in nitrogen-fixing activity of the fen1 nodules. Exogenous supply of homocitrate also recovered the nitrogen-fixing activity of the fen1 nodules through de novo nitrogenase synthesis in the rhizobial bacteroids. These results indicate that homocitrate derived from the host plant cells is essential for the efficient and continuing synthesis of the nitrogenase system in endosymbionts, and thus provide a molecular basis for the complementary and indispensable partnership between legumes and rhizobia in symbiotic nitrogen fixation.},

	Abstract = {Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is associated with swine respiratory diseases. Although gene organization and regulation are well known in many prokaryotic organisms, knowledge on mycoplasma is limited. This study performed a comparative analysis of three strains of M. hyopneumoniae (7448, J and 232), with a focus on genome organization and gene comparison for open read frame (ORF) cluster (OC) identification. An in silico analysis of gene organization demonstrated 117 OCs and 34 single ORFs in M. hyopneumoniae 7448 and J, while 116 OCs and 36 single ORFs were identified in M. hyopneumoniae 232. Genomic comparison revealed high synteny and conservation of gene order between the OCs defined for 7448 and J strains as well as for 7448 and 232 strains. Twenty-one OCs were chosen and experimentally confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR from M. hyopneumoniae 7448 genome, validating our prediction. A subset of the ORFs within an OC could be independently transcribed due to the presence of internal promoters. Our results suggest that transcription occurs in 'run-on' from an upstream promoter in M. hyopneumoniae, thus forming large ORF clusters (from 2 to 29 ORFs in the same orientation) and indicating a complex transcriptional organization.},

Computer analysis of known E. coli IS sequences showed signal characteristics in the entire model IS consisting of 47 bases, in segments of the 5' leader and of the protein-coding regions. The proposal that eukaryotic translation actually occurs in two steps is scrutinized. In a first step, initiation factors (eIF4F) interact with the cap of the mRNA, thereby enhancing the accessibility of the IS. In the second step, initiation is by the conserved prokaryotic mechanism in which the ribosomes bind directly to the mRNA without ribosomal scanning. This binding occurs by the proposed process of in reading frame binding of ribosomes to mRNA, which is consistent with the CS mechanism. The basic CS mechanism is able to account for the initiation of translation of leaderless mRNAs, as well as for that of canonical mRNAs. The SD, the scanning and the IRES mechanisms, on the other hand, are inconsistent with the initiation of translation of leaderless mRNAs. Based on these and other observations, it is deemed that the CS mechanism is the universal initiation mechanism.},

A DNA segment hybridizing to Klebsiella pneumoniae nifJ was isolated, the gene was inactivated, and a mutant strain, SNJ-1, was constructed by allele replacement. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Northern blotting and by the lack of pyruvate oxidoreductase activity. This is the first report of a nifJ-like gene in photosynthetic bacteria. Unexpectedly, SNJ-1 was capable of nitrogen fixation, and growth was similar to the wild-type strain under all conditions investigated. Therefore, this is also the first demonstration that a nifJ homologue, when present, is not essential for nitrogen fixation in a diazotroph. The nifJ-like gene was sequenced and found to have considerable similarity to published nifJ gene sequences from other organisms. By primer extension, the initiation site for transcription was located, and a typical sigma 54 promoter sequence was identified.},

	Abstract = {The formation of photosynthetic complexes in facultatively photosynthetic bacteria is controlled by the oxygen tension in the environment. In Rhodobacter capsulatus the two-component system RegB/RegA plays a major role in the redox control of photosynthesis genes but also controls other redox-dependent systems. The response regulator RegA is phosphorylated under low oxygen tension and activates the puf and puc operons, which encode pigment binding proteins, by binding to their promoter regions. Data from a yeast two-hybrid analysis as well as an in vitroanalysis indicate that RegA interacts with the NtrX protein, the response regulator of the NtrY/NtrX two-component system which is believed to be involved in regulation of nitrogen fixation genes. Our further analysis revealed that NtrX is indeed involved in the regulation of the puf and puc operons. Furthermore, we showed that an altered NtrX protein, which is predicted to adopt the conformation of phosphorylated NtrX protein, binds within the puf promoter region close to the RegA binding sites. We conclude that a direct interaction of two response regulators connects the regulatory systems for redox control and nitrogen control.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.

RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

We selected ssDNA aptamers that strongly and specifically bound free sigma(A) from Thermus aquaticus. A consensus sequence, GTA(C/T)AATGGGA, was required for aptamer binding to sigma(A), with the TA(C/T)AAT segment making interactions similar to those made by the -10 promoter element (consensus sequence TATAAT) in the context of RNA polymerase holoenzyme. When in dsDNA form, the aptamers function as strong promoters for the T. aquaticus RNA polymerase sigma(A) holoenzyme. Recognition of the aptamer-based promoters depends on the downstream GGGA motif from the aptamers' common sequence, which is contacted by sigma(A) region 1.2 and directs transcription initiation even in the absence of the -35 promoter element. Thus, recognition of bacterial promoters is controlled by independent interactions of sigma with multiple basal promoter elements.},

@article{Liu:2014ac,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important challenge in cancer biology is to computationally screen mutations in cancer cells, separating those that might drive cancer initiation and progression, from the much larger number of bystanders. Since mutations are large in number and diverse in type, the frequency of any particular mutation pattern across a set of samples is low. This makes statistical distinctions and reproducibility across different populations difficult to establish.

RESULTS: In this paper we develop a novel method that promises to partially ameliorate these problems. The basic idea is although mutations are highly heterogeneous and vary from one sample to another, the processes that are disrupted when cells undergo transformation tend to be invariant across a population for a particular cancer or cancer subtype. Specifically, we focus on finding mutated pathway-groups that are invariant across samples of breast cancer subtypes. The identification of informative pathway-groups consists of two steps. The first is identification of pathways significantly enriched in genes containing non-synonymous mutations; the second uses pathways so identified to find groups that are functionally related in the largest number of samples. An application to 4 subtypes of breast cancer identified pathway-groups that can highly explicate a particular subtype and rich in processes associated with transformation.

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous methods that identify pathways across a set of samples without any further validation, we show that mutated pathway-groups can be found in each breast cancer subtype and that such groups are invariant across the majority of samples. The algorithm is available at http://www.visantnet.org/misi/MUDPAC.zip.},

@article{Bauer1998,
	Abstract = {Many nitrogen fixation-associated genes in the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum are regulated by the transcriptional activator NifA, whose activity is inhibited by aerobiosis. NifA is encoded in the fixR-nifA operon, which is expressed at a low level under aerobic conditions and induced approximately fivefold under low-oxygen tension. This induction depends on a -24/-12-type promoter (fixRp1) that is recognized by the sigma54 RNA polymerase and activated by NifA. Low-level aerobic expression and part of the anaerobic expression originates from a second promoter (fixRp2) that overlaps with fixRp1 and depends on an upstream DNA region (UAS) located around position -68 (H. Barrios, H. M. Fischer, H. Hennecke, and E. Morett, J. Bacteriol. 177:1760-1765, 1995). A protein binding to the UAS was previously postulated to act as an activator. This protein has now been purified, and the corresponding gene (regR) has been cloned. On the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence, RegR belongs to the family of response regulators of two-component regulatory systems. We identified upstream of the regR gene an additional gene (regS) encoding a putative sensor kinase. A regR mutant was constructed in which neither a specific UAS-binding activity nor fixRp2-dependent transcript formation and fixR'-'lacZ expression was detected in aerobically grown cells. Anaerobic fixR'-'lacZ expression was also decreased in regR mutants to about 10{\%} of the level observed in the wild type. Similarly, regR mutants showed only about 2{\%} residual nitrogen fixation activity, but unlike nodules induced by nifA mutants, the morphology of those nodules was normal, displaying no signs of necrosis. While regR mutants grew only slightly slower in free-living, aerobic conditions, they displayed a strong growth defect under anaerobic conditions. The phenotypic properties of regS mutants differed only marginally, if at all, from those of the wild type, suggesting the existence of a compensating sensor activity in these strains. The newly identified RegR protein may be regarded as a master regulator in the NifA-dependent network controlling nif and fix gene expression in B. japonicum.},

	Abstract = {The last two decades have seen great advancements in our understanding of the prostate anatomy and approach including laparoscopic and robotic techniques. One should not however, forget that the techniques evolved with time. The history of developments in prostate cancer surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy is fascinating and urologists through the ages had the quest to find an ideal treatment for prostate cancer in spite of their limitations of resources and understanding. Surgeons have now practiced radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer for over 100 years. Initially feared because of its complications and difficulty, the operation can now be carried out safely owing principally to advances in our knowledge of the surgical anatomy. Refinements in surgical technique based on anatomical understanding have enabled morbidity to be progressively reduced to a widely acceptable level. Within the past 10 years, the same principles have been applied successfully in laparoscopic and robotic techniques of prostatectomy. There are constant improvements in the field of radiotherapy, evolution of cryotherapy and changes in the role of hormones. To the future, the matching of patients to the treatment modality most appropriate to their tumour, and quality of life outcomes are likely to become increasingly important in determining future practice. It is worth while to look at the evolution to plan for the future. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {RegSR-like proteins, members of the family of two-component regulatory systems, are present in a large number of proteobacteria in which they globally control gene expression mostly in a redox-responsive manner. The controlled target genes feature an enormous functional diversity. In Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the facultative root nodule symbiont of soybean, RegSR activate the transcription of the nitrogen fixation regulatory gene nifA, thus forming a RegSR-NifA cascade which is part of a complex regulatory network for gene regulation in response to changing oxygen concentrations. Whole-genome transcription profiling was performed here in order to assess the full regulatory scope of RegSR. The comparative analysis of wild-type and delta regR cells grown under oxic and microoxic conditions revealed that expression of almost 250 genes is dependent on RegR, a result that underscores the important contribution of RegR to oxygen- or redox-regulated gene expression in B. japonicum. Furthermore, transcription profiling of delta regR bacteroids compared with wild-type bacteroids revealed expression changes for about 1,200 genes in young and mature bacteroids. Incidentally, many of these were found to be induced in symbiosis when wild-type bacteroids were compared with free-living, culture-grown wild-type cells, and they appeared to encode diverse functions possibly related to symbiosis and nitrogen fixation. We demonstrated direct RegR-mediated control at promoter regions of several selected target genes by means of DNA binding experiments and in vitro transcription assays, which revealed six novel direct RegR target promoters.},

In the light, these responses are differentially shown by cultures that differ in the degree of their nitrogen limitation. Here we examined the response of these culture types to the addition of NH4+ under dark, microoxic conditions and found that all three responses can be observed under these conditions. However, the magnitude response was much more sensitive to the ammonium concentration, and the ADP-ribosylation response correlated only poorly with activity changes, similar to results obtained in the light. In contrast to previous reports, Fe-protein was not ADP-ribosylated in response to the presence of oxygen.},

@article{Vandin:2012aa,
	Abstract = {A major goal of cancer sequencing projects is to identify genetic alterations that determine clinical phenotypes, such as survival time or drug response. Somatic mutations in cancer are typically very diverse, and are found in different sets of genes in different patients. This mutational heterogeneity complicates the discovery of associations between individual mutations and a clinical phenotype. This mutational heterogeneity is explained in part by the fact that driver mutations, the somatic mutations that drive cancer development, target genes in cellular pathways, and only a subset of pathway genes is mutated in a given patient. Thus, pathway-based analysis of associations between mutations and phenotype are warranted. Here, we introduce an algorithm to find groups of genes, or pathways, whose mutational status is associated to a clinical phenotype without prior definition of the pathways. Rather, we find subnetworks of genes in an gene interaction network with the property that the mutational status of the genes in the subnetwork are significantly associated with a clinical phenotype. This new algorithm is built upon HotNet, an algorithm that finds groups of mutated genes using a heat diffusion model and a two-stage statistical test. We focus here on discovery of statistically significant correlations between mutated subnetworks and patient survival data. A similar approach can be used for correlations with other types of clinical data, through use of an appropriate statistical test. We apply our method to simulated data as well as to mutation and survival data from ovarian cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In the TCGA data, we discover nine subnetworks containing genes whose mutational status is correlated with survival. Genes in four of these subnetworks overlap known pathways, including the focal adhesion and cell adhesion pathways, while other subnetworks are novel.},

Currently, the majority of studies on the composition of protein complexes are carried out by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and present a static view of the system. For a better understanding of inherently dynamic biological processes, methods to reliably quantify temporal changes of protein interaction networks are essential. Here we used affinity purification combined with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra (AP-SWATH) mass spectrometry to study the dynamics of the 14-3-3$\beta$ scaffold protein interactome after stimulation of the insulin-PI3K-AKT pathway. The consistent and reproducible quantification of 1,967 proteins across all stimulation time points provided insights into the 14-3-3$\beta$ interactome and its dynamic changes following IGF1 stimulation. We therefore establish AP-SWATH as a tool to quantify dynamic changes in protein-complex interaction networks.},

Previous genetic studies have identified factors involved in MoFe protein assembly; however, the exact functions of these factors and the precise sequence of events during the process have remained unclear until the recent characterization of a number of assembly-related intermediates that provided significant insights into this biosynthetic "black box". This review summarizes the recent advances in elucidation of the mechanism of FeMoco biosynthesis in four aspects: (1) the ex situ assembly of FeMoco on NifEN, (2) the incorporation of FeMoco into MoFe protein, (3) the in situ assembly of P-cluster on MoFe protein, and (4) the stepwise assembly of MoFe protein.},

	Abstract = {Escherichia coli (E. coli) mazEF is a stress-induced toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. The toxin MazF is an endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded mRNAs at ACA sequences. Here, we show that MazF cleaves at ACA sites at or closely upstream of the AUG start codon of some specific mRNAs and thereby generates leaderless mRNAs. Moreover, we provide evidence that MazF also targets 16S rRNA within 30S ribosomal subunits at the decoding center, thereby removing 43 nucleotides from the 3' terminus. As this region comprises the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) sequence that is required for translation initiation on canonical mRNAs, a subpopulation of ribosomes is formed that selectively translates the described leaderless mRNAs both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, we have discovered a modified translation machinery that is generated in response to MazF induction and that probably serves for stress adaptation in Escherichia coli.},

	Abstract = {Bacterial small regulatory RNAs that act by base-pairing can be divided into two classes: cis-encoded and trans-encoded antisense RNAs. The former--mainly discovered in plasmids, phages and transposons--are encoded in the same DNA locus and are therefore completely complementary to their targets over a long sequence stretch. Regulatory mechanisms employed by these RNAs encompass inhibition of primer maturation or RNA pseudoknot formation, transcriptional attenuation, inhibition of translation or promotion of RNA degradation or cleavage. Although the final product of antisense RNA/target RNA binding is a full duplex that is degraded by RNase III, inhibition does not require complete duplex formation. By contrast, in many cases, partially paired binding intermediates have been shown to be sufficient for the biological function.},

@article{Huang:2012ab,
	Abstract = {Genomic islands (GIs), frequently associated with the pathogenicity of bacteria and having a substantial influence on bacterial evolution, are groups of "alien" elements which probably undergo special temporal-spatial regulation in the host genome. Are there particular hallmark transcriptional signals for these "exotic" regions? We here explore the potential transcriptional signals that underline the GIs beyond the conventional views on basic sequence composition, such as codon usage and GC property bias. It showed that there is a significant enrichment of the transcription start positions (TSPs) in the GI regions compared to the whole genome of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. There was up to a four-fold increase for the 70{\%} GIs, implying high-density TSPs profile can potentially differentiate the GI regions. Based on this feature, we developed a new sliding window method GIST, Genomic-island Identification by Signals of Transcription, to identify these regions. Subsequently, we compared the known GI-associated features of the GIs detected by GIST and by the existing method Islandviewer to those of the whole genome. Our method demonstrates high sensitivity in detecting GIs harboring genes with biased GI-like function, preferred subcellular localization, skewed GC property, shorter gene length and biased "non-optimal" codon usage. The special transcriptional signals discovered here may contribute to the coordinate expression regulation of foreign genes. Finally, by using GIST, we detected many interesting GIs in the 2011 German E. coli O104:H4 outbreak strain TY-2482, including the microcin H47 system and gene cluster ycgXEFZ-ymgABC that activates the production of biofilm matrix. The aforesaid findings highlight the power of GIST to predict GIs with distinct intrinsic features to the genome. The heterogeneity of cumulative TSPs profiles may not only be a better identity for "alien" regions, but also provide hints to the special evolutionary course and transcriptional regulation of GI regions.},

These sRNAs act by base pairing with target mRNAs with which they share limited or extended complementarity, or by modulating protein activity, in some cases by mimicking other nucleic acids. Mechanistic insights into how sRNAs bind mRNAs and proteins, how they compete with each other, and how they interface with ribonucleases are active areas of discovery. Current work also has begun to illuminate how sRNAs modulate expression of distinct regulons and key transcription factors, thus integrating sRNA activity into extensive regulatory networks. In addition, the application of RNA deep sequencing has led to reports of hundreds of additional sRNA candidates in a wide swath of bacterial species. Most importantly, recent studies have served to clarify the abundance of remaining questions about how, when, and why sRNA-mediated regulation is of such importance to bacterial lifestyles.},

	Abstract = {The generation of genome-scale data is becoming more routine, yet the subsequent analysis of omics data remains a significant challenge. Here, an approach that integrates multiple omics datasets with bioinformatics tools was developed that produces a detailed annotation of several microbial genomic features. This methodology was used to characterize the genome of Thermotoga maritima--a phylogenetically deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium. Experimental data were generated for whole-genome resequencing, transcription start site (TSS) determination, transcriptome profiling, and proteome profiling. These datasets, analyzed in combination with bioinformatics tools, served as a basis for the improvement of gene annotation, the elucidation of transcription units (TUs), the identification of putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and the determination of promoters and ribosome binding sites. This revealed many distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome organization relative to other bacteria. This genome has a high number of genes per TU (3.3), a paucity of putative ncRNAs (12), and few TUs with multiple TSSs (3.7{\%}). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome binding sites showed increased sequence conservation relative to other bacteria. The 5'UTRs follow an atypical bimodal length distribution comprised of "Short" 5'UTRs (11-17 nt) and "Common" 5'UTRs (26-32 nt). Transcriptional regulation is limited by a lack of intergenic space for the majority of TUs. Lastly, a high fraction of annotated genes are expressed independent of growth state and a linear correlation of mRNA/protein is observed (Pearson r = 0.63, p{\textless}2.2 × 10(-16) t-test). These distinctive properties are hypothesized to be a reflection of this organism's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and could yield novel insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on earth.},

	Abstract = {Alternative bacterial sigma factors bind the catalytic core RNA polymerase to confer promoter selectivity on the holoenzyme. The different holoenzymes are thus programmed to recognize the distinct promoter classes in the genome to allow coordinated activation of discrete sets of genes needed for adaptive responses. To form the holoenzymes, the different sigma factors must be available to compete for their common substrate (core RNA polymerase). This review highlights (a) the roles of antisigma factors in controlling the availability of alternative sigma factors and (b) the involvement of diverse regulatory molecules that promote the use of alternative sigma factors through subversion of the domineering housekeeping $\sigma$(70). The latter include the nucleotide alarmone ppGpp and small proteins (DksA, Rsd, and Crl), which directly target the transcriptional machinery to mediate their effects.},

	Abstract = {A substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression in eukaryotes. However, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. The transcriptomes of bacteria as different as Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Vibrio cholerae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pseudomonas syringae, and Staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense RNA (asRNA) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. Bacterial asRNAs share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory RNAs, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. Among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. Here, we review recent publications indicating that asRNAs occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asRNA actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. Emerging functional data suggest that asRNAs in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. Thus, the functional impact of asRNAs should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.},

	Abstract = {To date, mass spectrometry (MS) data remain inherently biased as a result of reasons ranging from sample handling to differences caused by the instrumentation. Normalization is the process that aims to account for the bias and make samples more comparable. The selection of a proper normalization method is a pivotal task for the reliability of the downstream analysis and results. Many normalization methods commonly used in proteomics have been adapted from the DNA microarray techniques. Previous studies comparing normalization methods in proteomics have focused mainly on intragroup variation. In this study, several popular and widely used normalization methods representing different strategies in normalization are evaluated using three spike-in and one experimental mouse label-free proteomic data sets. The normalization methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to reduce variation between technical replicates, their effect on differential expression analysis and their effect on the estimation of logarithmic fold changes. Additionally, we examined whether normalizing the whole data globally or in segments for the differential expression analysis has an effect on the performance of the normalization methods. We found that variance stabilization normalization (Vsn) reduced variation the most between technical replicates in all examined data sets. Vsn also performed consistently well in the differential expression analysis. Linear regression normalization and local regression normalization performed also systematically well. Finally, we discuss the choice of a normalization method and some qualities of a suitable normalization method in the light of the results of our evaluation.},

@article{Rhodius2010,
	Abstract = {Sequenced bacterial genomes provide a wealth of information but little understanding of transcriptional regulatory circuits largely because accurate prediction of promoters is difficult. We examined two important issues for accurate promoter prediction: (1) the ability to predict promoter strength and (2) the sequence properties that distinguish between active and weak/inactive promoters. We addressed promoter prediction using natural core promoters recognized by the well-studied alternative sigma factor, Escherichia coli sigma(E), as a representative of group 4 sigmas, the largest sigma group. To evaluate the contribution of sequence to promoter strength and function, we used modular position weight matrix models comprised of each promoter motif and a penalty score for suboptimal motif location. We find that a combination of select modules is moderately predictive of promoter strength and that imposing minimal motif scores distinguished active from weak/inactive promoters. The combined -35/-10 score is the most important predictor of activity. Our models also identified key sequence features associated with active promoters. A conserved "AAC" motif in the -35 region is likely to be a general predictor of function for promoters recognized by group 4 sigmas. These results provide valuable insights into sequences that govern promoter strength, distinguish active and inactive promoters for the first time, and are applicable to both in vivo and in vitro measures of promoter strength.},

Although DNA microarrays have been widely used to understand the critical events underlying growth, development, homeostasis, behavior and the onset of disease, the management of the resulting data has received little attention. Presently, the fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5 are most often used to prepare labeled cDNA for microarray hybridizations. Raw microarray data are image files that have to be transformed into gene expression formats--a process that requires data manipulation due to systematic variations which may be attributed to differences in the physical and chemical dye applications is to identify differences in transcript levels calculated from fluorescence ratios it is necessary to normalize fluorescence signals to compensate for systematic variations. Here, we will review current normalization strategies applied to cDNA microarrays and discuss their limits. We will show that experimental design determines normalization success.},

@article{Hodges:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes are related pathogens that cause crown gall and hairy root diseases, which result from integration and expression of bacterial genes in the plant genome. Single-stranded DNA (T strands) and virulence proteins are translocated into plant cells by a type IV secretion system. VirD2 nicks a specific DNA sequence, attaches to the 5' end, and pilots the DNA into plant cells. A. tumefaciens translocates single-stranded DNA-binding protein VirE2 into plant cells where it likely binds T strands and may aid in targeting them into the nucleus. Although some A. rhizogenes strains lack VirE2, they transfer T strands efficiently due to the GALLS gene, which complements an A. tumefaciens virE2 mutant for tumor formation. Unlike VirE2, full-length GALLS (GALLS-FL) contains ATP-binding and helicase motifs similar to those in TraA, a strand transferase involved in conjugation. GALLS-FL and VirE2 contain nuclear localization signals (NLS) and secretion signals. Mutations in any of these domains abolish the ability of the GALLS gene to substitute for virE2. Here, we show that the GALLS gene encodes two proteins from one open reading frame: GALLS-FL and a protein comprised of the C-terminal domain, which initiates at an internal in-frame start codon. On some hosts, both GALLS proteins were required to substitute for VirE2. GALLS-FL tagged with yellow fluorescent protein localized to the nucleus of tobacco cells in an NLS-dependent manner. In plant cells, the GALLS proteins interacted with themselves, VirD2, and each other. VirD2 interacted with GALLS-FL and localized inside the nucleus, where its predicted helicase activity may pull T strands into the nucleus.},

@article{Brock:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Leaderless mRNAs are translated in the absence of upstream signals that normally contribute to ribosome binding and translation efficiency. In order to identify ribosomal components that interact with leaderless mRNA, a fragment of leaderless cI mRNA from bacteriophage lambda, with a 4-thiouridine (4(S)-U) substituted at the +2 position of the AUG start codon, was used to form cross-links to Escherichia coli ribosomes during binary (mRNA+ribosome) and ternary (mRNA+ribosome+initiator tRNA) complex formation. Ribosome binding assays (i.e., toeprints) demonstrated tRNA-dependent binding of leaderless mRNA to ribosomes; however, cross-links between the start codon and 30S subunit rRNA and r-proteins formed independent of initiator tRNA. Toeprints revealed that a leaderless mRNA's 5'-AUG is required for stable binding. Furthermore, the addition of a 5'-terminal AUG triplet to a random RNA fragment can make it both competent and competitive for ribosome binding, suggesting that a leaderless mRNA's start codon is a major feature for ribosome interaction. Cross-linking assays indicate that a subset of 30S subunit r-proteins, located at either end of the mRNA tunnel, contribute to tRNA-independent contacts and/or interactions with a leaderless mRNA's start codon. The interaction of leaderless mRNA with ribosomes may reveal features of mRNA binding and AUG recognition that are distinct from known signals but are important for translation initiation of all mRNAs.},

	Abstract = {The influx of high-throughput data and the need for complex models to describe the interaction of prokaryotic transcription factors (TF) with their target sites pose new challenges for TF-binding site databases. CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on experimentally validated, naturally occurring TF-binding sites across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis on the transparency of the curation process, the quality and availability of the stored data and fully customizable access to its records. CollecTF integrates multiple sources of data automatically and openly, allowing users to dynamically redefine binding motifs and their experimental support base. Data quality and currency are fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house validation and curation of published literature. CollecTF entries are periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq complete genome records as link-out features, maximizing the visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq files with regulatory information. Seeking to facilitate comparative genomics and machine-learning analyses of regulatory interactions, in its initial release CollecTF provides domain-wide coverage of two TF families (LexA and Fur), as well as extensive representation for a clinically important bacterial family, the Vibrionaceae.},

	Abstract = {Diverse microorganisms are living as endophytes in plant tissues and as epiphytes on plant surfaces in nature. Questions about driving forces shaping the microbial community associated with plants remain unanswered. Because legumes developed systems to attain endosymbioses with rhizobia as well as mycorrhizae during their evolution, the above questions can be addressed using legume mutants relevant to genes for symbiosis. Analytical methods for the microbial community have recently been advanced by enrichment procedures of plant-associated microbes and culture-independent analyses targeting the small subunit of rRNA in microbial ecology. In this review, we first deal with interdisciplinary works on the global diversity of bacteria associated with field-grown soybeans with different nodulation genotypes and nitrogen application. A subpopulation of Proteobacteria in aerial parts of soybean shoots was likely to be regulated through both the autoregulation system for plant-rhizobium symbiosis and the nitrogen signaling pathway, suggesting that legumes accommodate a taxonomically characteristic microbial community through unknown plant-microbe communications. In addition to the community views, we then show multiphasic analysis of a beneficial rice endophyte for comparative bacterial genomics and plant responses. The significance and perspectives of community- and genome-based approaches are discussed to achieve a better understanding of plant-microbe interactions.},

	Abstract = {In specific plant organs, namely the root nodules of alfalfa, fixed nitrogen (ammonia) produced by the symbiotic partner Sinorhizobium meliloti supports the growth of the host plant in nitrogen-depleted environment. Here, we report that a derivative of S. meliloti carrying a mutation in the chromosomal ntrR gene induced nodules with enhanced nitrogen fixation capacity, resulting in an increased dry weight and nitrogen content of alfalfa. The efficient nitrogen fixation is a result of the higher expression level of the nifH gene, encoding one of the subunits of the nitrogenase enzyme, and nifA, the transcriptional regulator of the nif operon. The ntrR gene, controlled negatively by its own product and positively by the symbiotic regulator syrM, is expressed in the same zone of nodules as the nif genes. As a result of the nitrogen-tolerant phenotype of the strain, the beneficial effect of the mutation on efficiency is not abolished in the presence of the exogenous nitrogen source. The ntrR mutant is highly competitive in nodule occupancy compared with the wild-type strain. Sequence analysis of the mutant region revealed a new cluster of genes, termed the "ntrPR operon," which is highly homologous to a group of vap-related genes of various pathogenic bacteria that are presumably implicated in bacterium-host interactions. On the basis of its favorable properties, the strain is a good candidate for future agricultural utilization.},

	Abstract = {Evidence is accumulating that small, noncoding RNAs are important regulatory molecules. Computational and experimental searches have led to the identification of approximately 60 small RNA genes in Escherichia coli. However, most of these studies focused on the intergenic regions and assumed that small RNAs were {\textgreater}50 nt. Thus, the previous screens missed small RNAs encoded on the antisense strand of protein-coding genes and small RNAs of {\textless}50 nt. To identify additional small RNAs, we carried out a cloning-based screen focused on RNAs of 30-65 nt. In this screen, we identified RNA species corresponding to fragments of rRNAs, tRNAs and known small RNAs. Several of the small RNAs also corresponded to 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) and internal fragments of mRNAs. Four of the 3'-UTR-derived RNAs were highly abundant and two showed expression patterns that differed from the corresponding mRNAs, suggesting independent functions for the 3'-UTR-derived small RNAs. We also detected three previously unidentified RNAs encoded in intergenic regions and RNAs from the long direct repeat and hok/sok elements. In addition, we identified a few small RNAs that are expressed opposite protein-coding genes and could base pair with 5' or 3' ends of the mRNAs with perfect complementarity.},

The database comprises of a million terminators identified in 1060 bacterial genome sequences and 798 plasmids. Users can obtain both graphic and tabular results on putative terminators based on default or user-defined parameters. The results are arranged in different tiers to facilitate retrieval, as per the specific requirements. An interactive map has been incorporated to visualize the distribution of terminators across the whole genome. Analysis of the results, both at the whole-genome level and with respect to terminators downstream of specific genes, offers insight into the prevalence of canonical and non-canonical terminators across different phyla. The data in the database reinforce the paradigm that intrinsic termination is a conserved and efficient regulatory mechanism in bacteria. Our database is freely accessible.},

MTDH is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancers. The present systematic review was performed to search for studies regarding MTDH and prostate, bladder and kidney cancer using several databases and the eligible studies were reviewed. MTDH expression was found to significantly increase in prostate, bladder and kidney cancers, not only in clinical tissue samples, but also in cancer cell lines. Reviewing the clinical and statistical analysis revealed that MTDH may be involved in urologic cancer progression, metastasis and prognosis. MTDH may be an independent or one of the cofactors in urologic cancers for prediction of patient survival, and may be involved in potential anticancer strategies. MTDH may be associated with several signal transduction pathways in urologic cancers, indicating latent targets to develop anticancer therapeutic strategy. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.},

	Abstract = {Background: After more than a decade of biomarker discovery research using advanced genomic and proteomic technologies, very few biomarkers have been translated into clinical diagnostics for patient care. This has become an urgent issue to be addressed because the continuing funding from both the public and private sources are called into question. Methods: We use as an example, OVA1, the first in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) of proteomic biomarkers recently cleared by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to describe our experience through the long road from biomarker discovery, to validation, and finally to multi-institutional trial for regulatory approval by the FDA. Results: We discuss 3 issues that are key bridges in the path of biomarker development to actual clinical diagnostics: 1) to generate sufficient and ``portable'' evidence in preliminary validation studies to support investment for large-scale validation trials; 2) to carefully and clearly define clinical utility that balances desire for broad applicability and feasibility for completing clinical trials for regulatory approval; and 3) to select/develop assays with analytical performance suitable for clinical deployment. Conclusions: We learned that the road from biomarker discovery, validation, to clinical diagnostics could be long and winding, and often frustrating. However, we also know that, with the right approaches, at the end of the road, there is a rainbow waiting for us. Impact: Provide insights and recommendations for the translation of proteomic biomarkers into clinical diagnostics. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(12); 2995--9. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR .},

@article{Scharff:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The initiation of translation is a fundamental and highly regulated process in gene expression. Translation initiation in prokaryotic systems usually requires interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon, the so-called ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence). However, a large number of genes do not possess Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and it is unknown how start codon recognition occurs in these mRNAs. We have performed genome-wide searches in various groups of prokaryotes in order to identify sequence elements and/or RNA secondary structural motifs that could mediate translation initiation in mRNAs lacking Shine-Dalgarno sequences. We find that mRNAs without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence are generally less structured in their translation initiation region and show a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, we also provide experimental support for local RNA unfoldedness determining start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno--independent translation. Consistent with this, we show that AUG start codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal AUG codons are usually in structured regions of the mRNA. Taken together, our bioinformatics analyses and experimental data suggest that local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno--independent translation. Thus, our results provide a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site.},

@article{Lyubetsky:2011aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modeling of a complex biological process can explain the results of experimental studies and help predict its characteristics. Among such processes is transcription in the presence of competing RNA polymerases. This process involves RNA polymerases collision followed by transcription termination.

RESULTS: A mathematical and computer simulation model is developed to describe the competition of RNA polymerases during genes transcription on complementary DNA strands. E.g., in the barley Hordeum vulgare the polymerase competition occurs in the locus containing plastome genes psbA, rpl23, rpl2 and four bacterial type promoters. In heat shock experiments on isolated chloroplasts, a twofold decrease of psbA transcripts and even larger increase of rpl23-rpl2 transcripts were observed, which is well reproduced in the model. The model predictions are in good agreement with virtually all relevant experimental data (knockout, heat shock, chromatogram data, etc.). The model allows to hypothesize a mechanism of cell response to knockout and heat shock, as well as a mechanism of gene expression regulation in presence of RNA polymerase competition. The model is implemented for multiprocessor platforms with MPI and supported on Linux and MS Windows. The source code written in C++ is available under the GNU General Public License from the laboratory website. A user-friendly GUI version is also provided at http://lab6.iitp.ru/en/rivals.

CONCLUSIONS: The developed model is in good agreement with virtually all relevant experimental data. The model can be applied to estimate intensities of binding of the holoenzyme and phage type RNA polymerase to their promoters using data on gene transcription levels, as well as to predict characteristics of RNA polymerases and the transcription process that are difficult to measure directly, e.g., the intensity (frequency) of holoenzyme binding to the promoter in correlation to its nucleotide composition and the type of $\sigma$-subunit, the amount of transcription initiation aborts, etc. The model can be used to make functional predictions, e.g., heat shock response in isolated chloroplasts and changes of gene transcription levels under knockout of different $\sigma$-subunits or RNA polymerases or due to gene expression regulation.},

	Abstract = {The phenotypic consequences of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are presumably due to their effects on protein expression levels. Yet, the impact of genetic variation, including eQTLs, on protein levels remains poorly understood. To address this, we mapped genetic variants that are associated with eQTLs, ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). We found that most QTLs are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we identified a class of cis QTLs that affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA or ribosome levels, suggesting that they may arise from differences in post-translational regulation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-scale prediction of gene regulation and reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria is one of the critical tasks of modern genomics. The Shewanella genus is comprised of metabolically versatile gamma-proteobacteria, whose lifestyles and natural environments are substantially different from Escherichia coli and other model bacterial species. The comparative genomics approaches and computational identification of regulatory sites are useful for the in silico reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.

RESULTS: To explore conservation and variations in the Shewanella transcriptional networks we analyzed the repertoire of transcription factors and performed genomics-based reconstruction and comparative analysis of regulons in 16 Shewanella genomes. The inferred regulatory network includes 82 transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, 8 riboswitches and 6 translational attenuators. Forty five regulons were newly inferred from the genome context analysis, whereas others were propagated from previously characterized regulons in the Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas spp.. Multiple variations in regulatory strategies between the Shewanella spp. and E. coli include regulon contraction and expansion (as in the case of PdhR, HexR, FadR), numerous cases of recruiting non-orthologous regulators to control equivalent pathways (e.g. PsrA for fatty acid degradation) and, conversely, orthologous regulators to control distinct pathways (e.g. TyrR, ArgR, Crp).

CONCLUSIONS: We tentatively defined the first reference collection of {\~{}}100 transcriptional regulons in 16 Shewanella genomes. The resulting regulatory network contains {\~{}}600 regulated genes per genome that are mostly involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, metals, and stress responses. Several reconstructed regulons including NagR for N-acetylglucosamine catabolism were experimentally validated in S. oneidensis MR-1. Analysis of correlations in gene expression patterns helps to interpret the reconstructed regulatory network. The inferred regulatory interactions will provide an additional regulatory constrains for an integrated model of metabolism and regulation in S. oneidensis MR-1.},

@article{Navarro-Llorens:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Conditions that sustain constant bacterial growth are seldom found in nature. Oligotrophic environments and competition among microorganisms force bacteria to be able to adapt quickly to rough and changing situations. A particular lifestyle composed of continuous cycles of growth and starvation is commonly referred to as feast and famine. Bacteria have developed many different mechanisms to survive in nutrient-depleted and harsh environments, varying from producing a more resistant vegetative cell to complex developmental programmes. As a consequence of prolonged starvation, certain bacterial species enter a dynamic nonproliferative state in which continuous cycles of growth and death occur until 'better times' come (restoration of favourable growth conditions). In the laboratory, microbiologists approach famine situations using batch culture conditions. The entrance to the stationary phase is a very regulated process governed by the alternative sigma factor RpoS. Induction of RpoS changes the gene expression pattern, aiming to produce a more resistant cell. The study of stationary phase revealed very interesting phenomena such as the growth advantage in stationary phase phenotype. This review focuses on some of the interesting responses of gram-negative bacteria when they enter the fascinating world of stationary phase.},

@article{Yurgel:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 Delta glnD-sm2 mutant, which is predicted to make a GlnD nitrogen sensor protein truncated at its amino terminus, fixes nitrogen in symbiosis with alfalfa, but the plants cannot use this nitrogen for growth (S. N. Yurgel and M. L. Kahn, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105:18958-18963, 2008). The mutant also has a generalized nitrogen stress response (NSR) defect. These results suggest a connection between GlnD, symbiotic metabolism, and the NSR, but the nature of this connection is unknown. In many bacteria, GlnD modifies the PII proteins, GlnB and GlnK, as it transduces a measurement of bacterial nitrogen status to a cellular response. We have now constructed and analyzed Rm1021 mutants missing GlnB, GlnK, or both proteins. Rm1021 Delta glnK Delta glnB was much more defective in its NSR than either single mutant, suggesting that GlnB and GlnK overlap in regulating the NSR in free-living Rm1021. The single mutants and the double mutant all formed an effective symbiosis, indicating that symbiotic nitrogen exchange could occur without the need for either GlnB or GlnK. N-terminal truncation of the GlnD protein interfered with PII protein modification in vitro, suggesting either that unmodified PII proteins were responsible for the glnD mutant's ineffective phenotype or that connecting GlnD and appropriate symbiotic behavior does not require the PII proteins.},

	Abstract = {Accurate prediction of peptide fragment ion mass spectra is one of the critical factors to guarantee confident peptide identification by protein sequence database search in bottom-up proteomics. In an attempt to accurately and comprehensively predict this type of mass spectra, a framework named MS(2)PBPI is proposed. MS(2)PBPI first extracts fragment ions from large-scale MS/MS spectra data sets according to the peptide fragmentation pathways and uses binary trees to divide the obtained bulky data into tens to more than 1000 regions. For each adequate region, stochastic gradient boosting tree regression model is constructed. By constructing hundreds of these models, MS(2)PBPI is able to predict MS/MS spectra for unmodified and modified peptides with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, high consistency between predicted and experimental MS/MS spectra derived from different ion trap instruments with low and high resolving power is achieved. MS(2)PBPI outperforms existing algorithms MassAnalyzer and PeptideART.},

@article{Cullen1996a,
	Abstract = {Enhancer-dependent transcription in enteric bacteria depends upon an activator protein that binds DNA far upstream from the promoter and an alternative sigma factor (sigma 54) that binds with the core RNA polymerase at the promoter. In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, the NtrB and NtrC proteins (RcNtrB and RcNtrC) are putative members of a two-component system that is novel because the enhancer-binding RcNtrC protein activates transcription of sigma 54-independent promoters. To reconstitute this putative two-component system in vitro, the ReNtrB protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a maltose-binding protein fusion (MBP-RcNtrB). MBP-RcNtrB autophosphorylates in vitro to the same steady state level and with the same stability as the Salmonella typhimurium NtrB (StNtrB) protein but at a lower initial rate. MBP-RcNtrB autophosphorylates the S.typhimurium NtrC (St-NtrC) and RcNtrC proteins in vitro. The enteric NtrC protein is also phosphorylated in vivo by RcNtrB because plasmids that encode either RcNtrB or MBP-Rc-NtrB activate transcription of an NtrC-dependent nifL-lacZ fusion. The rate of phosphotransfer to RcNtrC and autophosphatase activity of phosphorylated RcNtrC (RcNtrC---P) are comparable to the StNtrC protein. However, the RcNtrC protein appears to be a specific RcNtrB P phosphatase since RcNtrC is not phosphorylated by small molecular weight phosphate compounds or by the StNtrB protein. RcNtrC forms a dimer in solution, and RcNtrC - P binds the upstream tandem binding sites of the g1nB promoter 4-fold better than the unphos-phorylated RcNtrC protein, presumably due to oligomerization of RcNtrC -P. Therefore, the R. capsulatus NtrB and NtrC proteins form a two-component system similar to other NtrC-like systems, where specific Rc- NtrB phosphotransfer to the RcNtrC protein results in increased oligoinerization at the enhancer but with subsequent activation of a sigma 54-independent promoter.},

	Abstract = {The PII family of signal transduction proteins are among the most widely distributed signal proteins in the bacterial world. First identified in 1969 as a component of the glutamine synthetase regulatory apparatus, PII proteins have since been recognized as playing a pivotal role in control of prokaryotic nitrogen metabolism. More recently, members of the family have been found in higher plants, where they also potentially play a role in nitrogen control. The PII proteins can function in the regulation of both gene transcription, by modulating the activity of regulatory proteins, and the catalytic activity of enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism. There is also emerging evidence that they may regulate the activity of proteins required for transport of nitrogen compounds into the cell. In this review we discuss the history of the PII proteins, their structures and biochemistry, and their distribution and functions in prokaryotes. We survey data emerging from bacterial genome sequences and consider other likely or potential targets for control by PII proteins.},

In this review we summarize recent advances in LC-MS-based proteomics profiling and its applications in clinical proteomics as well as discuss the major challenges associated with implementing these technologies for more effective candidate biomarker discovery. Developments in immunoaffinity depletion and various fractionation approaches in combination with substantial improvements in LC-MS platforms have enabled the plasma proteome to be profiled with considerably greater dynamic range of coverage, allowing many proteins at low ng/ml levels to be confidently identified. Despite these significant advances and efforts, major challenges associated with the dynamic range of measurements and extent of proteome coverage, confidence of peptide/protein identifications, quantitation accuracy, analysis throughput, and the robustness of present instrumentation must be addressed before a proteomics profiling platform suitable for efficient clinical applications can be routinely implemented.},

Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been revolutionizing global transcriptomic analysis. Here, using a novel differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the 5' end of primary transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional start sites and operons. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional start sites within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, indicating that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of approximately 60 small RNAs including the epsilon-subdivision counterpart of the regulatory 6S RNA and associated RNA products, and potential regulators of cis- and trans-encoded target messenger RNAs. Our approach establishes a paradigm for mapping and annotating the primary transcriptomes of many living species.},

@article{Wu:2014ac,
	Abstract = {The malignant transformation of cells requires adaptations across multiple metabolic processes to satisfy the energy required for their increased rate of proliferation. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism has been a hallmark of the malignant phenotype; increased lipid accumulation secondary to changes in the levels of a variety of lipid metabolic enzymes has been documented in a variety of tumors, including prostate. Alterations in prostate lipid metabolism include upregulation of several lipogenic enzymes as well as of enzymes that function to oxidize fatty acids as an energy source. Cholesterol metabolism and phospholipid metabolism are also affected. With respect to lipogenesis, most studies have concentrated on increased expression and activity ofthe de novo fatty acid synthesis enzyme, fatty acid synthase (FASN), with suggestions that FASN might function as an oncogene. A central role for fatty acid oxidation in supplying energy to the prostate cancer cell is supported by the observation that the peroxisomal enzyme, $\alpha$-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), which facilitates the transformation of branched chain fatty acids to a form suitable for $\beta$-oxidation, is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate. Exploitation of the alterations in lipid metabolic pathways in prostate cancer could result in the development of new therapeutic modalities as well as provide candidates for new prognostic and predictive biomarkers. AMACR has already proven to be a valuable biomarker in distinguishing normal from malignant prostate tissue, and is used routinely in clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) medicae is an effective nitrogen fixing microsymbiont of a diverse range of annual Medicago (medic) species. Strain WSM419 is an aerobic, motile, non-spore forming, Gram-negative rod isolated from a M. murex root nodule collected in Sardinia, Italy in 1981. WSM419 was manufactured commercially in Australia as an inoculant for annual medics during 1985 to 1993 due to its nitrogen fixation, saprophytic competence and acid tolerance properties. Here we describe the basic features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence, and annotation. This is the first report of a complete genome sequence for a microsymbiont of the group of annual medic species adapted to acid soils. We reveal that its genome size is 6,817,576 bp encoding 6,518 protein-coding genes and 81 RNA only encoding genes. The genome contains a chromosome of size 3,781,904 bp and 3 plasmids of size 1,570,951 bp, 1,245,408 bp and 219,313 bp. The smallest plasmid is a feature unique to this medic microsymbiont.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, cancer genome sequencing and other high-throughput studies of cancer genomes have generated many notable discoveries. In this review, novel genomic alteration mechanisms, such as chromothripsis (chromosomal crisis) and kataegis (mutation storms), and their implications for cancer are discussed. Genomic alterations spur cancer genome evolution. Thus, the relationship between cancer clonal evolution and cancer stems cells is commented. The key question in cancer biology concerns how these genomic alterations support cancer development and metastasis in the context of biological functioning. Thus far, efforts such as pathway analysis have improved the understanding of the functional contributions of genetic mutations and DNA copy number variations to cancer development, progression and metastasis. However, the known pathways correspond to a small fraction, plausibly 5-10{\%}, of somatic mutations and genes with an altered copy number. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the function of these genomic alterations in cancer, an integrative network framework is proposed and discussed. Finally, the challenges and the directions of studying cancer omic data using an integrative network approach are commented.},

	Abstract = {RecX is a small protein that interacts with, and modulates the activity of, RecA protein. In mycobacteria the recX gene is located immediately downstream of the recA gene, and the coding regions overlap. It has previously been shown that these two genes are co-transcribed in Mycobacterium smegmatis. In this study we examine the expression of recX in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition to being co-transcribed with recA from the DNA-damage inducible recA promoters, we identify a constitutive recX promoter located within the recA coding sequence that is strong enough to make a significant contribution to the expression level of recX in the absence of DNA damage. Intriguingly, this promoter is inactivated in M. smegmatis by a critical base change in the -10 promoter motif, which probably accounts for the lower level of expression of recX relative to recA that we observed in that species. It is possible that this difference in relative expression influences RecA functions including the response to DNA damage of LexA-regulated genes.},

To understand the effects of the Sinorhizobium meliloti nifA gene on Alfalfa, the cDNA-AFLP technique was employed to study the changes in gene expression in nifA mutant nodules. Among the approximately 3,000 transcript-derived fragments, 37 had differential expression levels. These expression levels were subsequently confirmed by reverse Northern blot and RT-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analyses revealed that 21 cDNA fragments corresponded to genes involved in signal communication, protein degradation, nutrient metabolism, cell growth and development.},

@article{Milon:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Translational initiation factor 2 (IF2) is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that can bind guanosine 3',5'-(bis) diphosphate (ppGpp), an alarmone involved in stringent response in bacteria. In cells growing under optimal conditions, the GTP concentration is very high, and that of ppGpp very low. However, under stress conditions, the GTP concentration may decline by as much as 50{\%}, and that of ppGpp can attain levels comparable to those of GTP. Here we show that IF2 binds ppGpp at the same nucleotide-binding site and with similar affinity as GTP. Thus, GTP and the alarmone ppGpp can be considered two alternative physiologically relevant IF2 ligands. ppGpp interferes with IF2-dependent initiation complex formation, severely inhibits initiation dipeptide formation, and blocks the initiation step of translation. Our data suggest that IF2 has the properties of a cellular metabolic sensor and regulator that oscillates between an active GTP-bound form under conditions allowing active protein syntheses and an inactive ppGpp-bound form when shortage of nutrients would be detrimental, if not accompanied by slackening of this synthesis.},

	Abstract = {The Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae gum gene cluster is composed of 14 ORFs designated, in sequence, as gumB to M, XOO3167, and gumN. The gum gene cluster constitutes an operon expressed from multiple promoters located upstream of gumB and gumG, respectively. To identify new promoters responsible for the expression of the gum gene cluster, we have conducted a computer-assisted promoter search and identified previously unreported promoter-like sequences upstream of the gumH and gumM genes, respectively. Moreover, the ability of these putative promoters to stimulate the transcription of the downstream genes was demonstrated by RT-PCR analyses using the mutant strains carrying an insertion of the rrnB transcriptional terminator into the gumG, gumH, and gumL gene, respectively.},

	Abstract = {We describe the comprehensive analysis of the yeast proteome in just over one hour of optimized analysis. We achieve this expedited proteome characterization with improved sample preparation, chromatographic separations, and by using a new Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with a mass filter, a collision cell, a high-field Orbitrap analyzer, and, finally, a dual cell linear ion trap analyzer (Q-OT-qIT, Orbitrap Fusion). This system offers high MS(2) acquisition speed of 20 Hz and detects up to 19 peptide sequences within a single second of operation. Over a 1.3 h chromatographic method, the Q-OT-qIT hybrid collected an average of 13,447 MS(1) and 80,460 MS(2) scans (per run) to produce 43,400 (x) peptide spectral matches and 34,255 (x) peptides with unique amino acid sequences (1{\%} false discovery rate (FDR)). On average, each one hour analysis achieved detection of 3,977 proteins (1{\%} FDR). We conclude that further improvements in mass spectrometer scan rate could render comprehensive analysis of the human proteome within a few hours.},

@article{Antonov2013,
	Abstract = {Our goal was to identify evolutionary conserved frame transitions in protein coding regions and to uncover an underlying functional role of these structural aberrations. We used the ab initio frameshift prediction program, GeneTack, to detect reading frame transitions in 206 991 genes (fs-genes) from 1106 complete prokaryotic genomes. We grouped 102 731 fs-genes into 19 430 clusters based on sequence similarity between protein products (fs-proteins) as well as conservation of predicted position of the frameshift and its direction. We identified 4010 pseudogene clusters and 146 clusters of fs-genes apparently using recoding (local deviation from using standard genetic code) due to possessing specific sequence motifs near frameshift positions. Particularly interesting was finding of a novel type of organization of the dnaX gene, where recoding is required for synthesis of the longer subunit, $\tau$. We selected 20 clusters of predicted recoding candidates and designed a series of genetic constructs with a reporter gene or affinity tag whose expression would require a frameshift event. Expression of the constructs in Escherichia coli demonstrated enrichment of the set of candidates with sequences that trigger genuine programmed ribosomal frameshifting; we have experimentally confirmed four new families of programmed frameshifts.},

	Abstract = {Separation selectivity of C18 reversed-phase columns from different manufacturers has been compared to evaluate the applicability of our sequence-specific retention calculator (SSRCalc) peptide retention prediction algorithms. Three different versions of SSRCalc are currently in use: 300-A pore size sorbents (TFA as ion-pairing modifier, pH 2), 100 A (TFA, pH 2), and 100 A (pH 10), which have been applied for the separation of randomly chosen mixture of tryptic peptides. The major factor affecting separation selectivity of C18 sorbents was found to be apparent pore size, while differences in end-capping chemistry do not introduce a significant impact. The introduction of embedded polar groups to the C18 functionality increases the retention of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acid residues with polar groups: Tyr and Trp. We also demonstrate that changing the ion-pairing modifier to formic/acetic acid significantly reduces the algorithm's predictive ability, so models developed for different eluent conditions cannot be compared directly to each other.},

@article{Silby2008,
	Abstract = {The annotated genome sequences of prokaryotes seldom include overlapping genes encoded opposite each other by the same stretch of DNA. However, antisense transcription is becoming recognized as a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes, and examples have been linked to important biological processes. Pseudomonas fluorescens inhabits aquatic and terrestrial environments, and can be regarded as an environmental generalist. The genetic basis for this ecological success is not well understood. In a previous search for soil-induced genes in P. fluorescens Pf0-1, ten antisense genes were discovered. These were termed 'cryptic' genes, as they had escaped detection by gene-hunting algorithms, and lacked easily recognizable promoters. In this communication, we designate such genes as 'non-predicted' or 'hidden'. Using reverse transcription PCR, we show that at each of six non-predicted gene loci chosen for study, transcription occurs from both 'sense' and 'antisense' DNA strands. Further, at least one of these hidden antisense genes, iiv14, encodes a protein, as does the sense transcript, both identified by poly-histidine tags on the C-terminus of the proteins. Mutational and complementation studies showed that this novel antisense gene was important for efficient colonization of soil, and multiple copies in the wildtype host improved the speed of soil colonization. Introduction of a stop codon early in the gene eliminated complementation, further implicating the protein in colonization of soil. We therefore designate iiv14 "cosA". These data suggest that, as is the case with eukaryotes, some bacterial genomes are more densely coded than currently recognized.},

@article{Rey2006,
	Abstract = {Rhodopseudomonas palustris is a purple, facultatively phototrophic bacterium that uses hydrogen gas as an electron donor for carbon dioxide fixation during photoautotrophic growth or for ammonia synthesis during nitrogen fixation. It also uses hydrogen as an electron supplement to enable the complete assimilation of oxidized carbon compounds, such as malate, into cell material during photoheterotrophic growth. The R. palustris genome predicts a membrane-bound nickel-iron uptake hydrogenase and several regulatory proteins to control hydrogenase synthesis. There is also a novel sensor kinase gene (RPA0981) directly adjacent to the hydrogenase gene cluster. Here we show that the R. palustris regulatory sensor hydrogenase HupUV acts in conjunction with the sensor kinase-response regulator protein pair HoxJ-HoxA to activate hydrogenase expression in response to hydrogen gas. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the HupUV-HoxJA regulatory system also controls the expression of genes encoding a predicted dicarboxylic acid transport system, a putative formate transporter, and a glutamine synthetase. RPA0981 had a small effect in repressing hydrogenase synthesis. We also determined that the two-component system RegS-RegR repressed expression of the uptake hydrogenase, probably in response to changes in intracellular redox status. Transcriptome analysis indicated that about 30 genes were differentially expressed in R. palustris cells that utilized hydrogen when growing photoheterotrophically on malate under nitrogen-fixing conditions compared to a mutant strain that lacked uptake hydrogenase. From this it appears that the recycling of reductant in the form of hydrogen does not have extensive nonspecific effects on gene expression in R. palustris.},

	Abstract = {Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 nifA regulation is partially mediated by the nitrogen regulatory gene ntrC. However, the residual nifA expression in ntrC mutant strains is still modulated by the cellular nitrogen and oxygen status. A second ntrC-homologous region, linked to ntrC, was identified and characterized by site-directed insertion mutagenesis and DNA sequencing. Tn5 insertions in this region cause pleiotropic defects in nitrogen metabolism and affect free-living as well as symbiotic nitrogen fixation. DNA sequencing and complementation studies revealed the existence of a bicistronic operon (ntrYX). NtrY is likely to represent the transmembrane 'sensor' protein element in a two-component regulatory system. NtrX shares a high degree of homology with NtrC proteins of other organisms and probably constitutes the regulator protein element. The regulation of the ntrYX and ntrC loci and the effects of ntrYX, ntrY and ntrX mutations on nifA expression were examined using beta-galactosidase gene fusions. NtrY/NtrX were found to modulate nifA expression and ntrYX transcription was shown to be partially under the control of NtrC.},

	Abstract = {A large number of bacteria regulate chaperone gene expression by the CIRCE-HrcA system in which a DNA element called CIRCE serves as binding site for the repressor protein HrcA under non-heat-shock conditions. We have cloned the two consecutive genes hrcA and grpE of Bradyrhizobium japonicum by using a complementation approach that screened for GrpE function. In vivo and in vitro transcript mapping demonstrated that both genes are transcribed separately from RpoH (sigma(32))-dependent promoters. To investigate the supposed negative regulatory function of HrcA, we compared the expression of putative target genes in the wild type with that in an hrcA mutant. Transcription of the CIRCE-associated chaperonin operons groESL(4) and groESL(5), as well as the beta-galactosidase activity derived from corresponding groE-lacZ fusions, was strongly elevated in the hrcA mutant even at physiological temperatures. Expression of other heat shock regulons (RpoH or ROSE dependent) was not affected. To study the activity of HrcA in vitro, we purified a histidine-tagged version of the protein under nondenaturing conditions. Specific binding to the CIRCE element was obtained with a soluble fraction of HrcA in gel retardation experiments.},

Transcription analysis of the nifA gene, assessed using promoter deletions, indicated an oxygen-independent expression, threefold higher during symbiosis as compared with free-living conditions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using those nifA promoter deletion fragments, which were actively transcribed, demonstrated the specific interaction with R. etli cellular protein(s) resulting in the formation of two DNA-protein complexes. An interacting protein was purified by liquid chromatography on Heparin Sepharose and Mono S columns. The purified 12 kDa R. etli protein cross-reacted with antibodies directed against Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF). Furthermore, purified E. coli IHF was able to specifically bind to the R. etli nifA promoter region. These results point to an as yet undisclosed function of IHF in the regulation of R. etli nifA expression.},

Exome is a part of genome formed by exons which are the protein-coding portions of genes. The whole-exome sequencing information can reflect the mutations of the protein-coding region in the genome and depict the causal relationship between the mutations and phenotypes. Now, many network-based methods have been developed to identify cancer driver modules or pathways, which not only provide new insights into molecular mechanism of disease progression at network level but also can avoid low coverage or lowly recurrent on disease samples in contrast to individual driver genes. In this review, we focus on the recent advances on network-based methods for identifying cancer driver modules or pathways, including methods of whole-exome sequencing, somatic mutation detection, driver mutation identification, and mutation network reconstruction.},

Transcriptional start sites are identified by analyzing probe signal cross-correlation matrices created from probe pairs tiled every 5 bp upstream of the genes. Signals from probes binding the same message are correlated. The contribution of each promoter for genes transcribed from multiple promoters is identified. Knowing the transcription start site enables targeted searching for regulatory-protein binding motifs in the promoter regions of genes with similar expression patterns. We identified 27 motifs, 17 of which share no similarity to the characterized motifs of other C. crescentus transcriptional regulators. Using these motifs, we predict coregulated genes. We verified novel promoter motifs that regulate stress-response genes, including those responding to uranium challenge, a stress-response sigma factor and a stress-response noncoding RNA.},

	Abstract = {A DNA microarray, comprising 70-mer oligonucleotides, representing 8,453 open reading frames (ORFs), was constructed based on the Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110 genomic sequence. New annotation predicted 199 additional genes, which were added to the microarray and were shown to be transcribed. These arrays were used to profile transcription in cells under a variety of conditions, including growth in minimal versus rich medium, osmotic stress, and free-living cells versus bacteroids. Increased expression was seen for genes involved in translation, motility, and cell envelope synthesis in rich medium whereas expression increased in minimal medium for genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and stress responses. Treatment with 50 mM NaCl activated stress-inducible genes but repressed genes involved in chemotaxis and motility. Strikingly, no known transport systems for accumulation of compatible solutes or osmoprotectants were induced in response to osmotic stress. A number of nif, fix, and hup genes, but not all, were upregulated in bacteroids. The B. japonicum type III secretion system, known to be important in early nodulation, was downregulated in bacteroids. The availability of a reliable, low-cost B. japonicum microarray provides a useful tool for functional genomic studies of one of the most agriculturally important bacteria.},

	Abstract = {Emerging knowledge of whole prokaryotic transcriptomes could validate a number of theoretical concepts introduced in the early days of genomics. What are the rules connecting gene expression levels with sequence determinants such as quantitative scores of promoters and terminators? Are translation efficiency measures, e.g. codon adaptation index and RBS score related to gene expression? We used the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing of a bacterial pathogen Bacillus anthracis to assess correlation of gene expression level with promoter, terminator and RBS scores, codon adaptation index, as well as with a new measure of gene translational efficiency, average translation speed. We compared computational predictions of operon topologies with the transcript borders inferred from RNA-Seq reads. Transcriptome mapping may also improve existing gene annotation. Upon assessment of accuracy of current annotation of protein-coding genes in the B. anthracis genome we have shown that the transcriptome data indicate existence of more than a hundred genes missing in the annotation though predicted by an ab initio gene finder. Interestingly, we observed that many pseudogenes possess not only a sequence with detectable coding potential but also promoters that maintain transcriptional activity.},

	Abstract = {Despite its importance in post-transcriptional regulation of polycistronic operons in Escherichia coli, little is known about the mechanism of translation re-initiation, which occurs when the same ribosome used to translate an upstream open reading frame (ORF) also translates a downstream ORF. To investigate translation re-initiation in Escherichia coli, we constructed a di-cistronic reporter in which a firefly luciferase gene was linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene using a segment of the translationally coupled geneV-geneVII intercistronic region from M13 phage. With this reporter and mutant initiator tRNAs, we show that two of the unique properties of E. coli initiator tRNA - formylation of the amino acid attached to the tRNA and binding of the tRNA to the ribosomal P-site - are as important for re-initiation as for de novo initiation. Overexpression of IF2 or increasing the affinity of mutant initiator tRNA for IF2 enhanced re-initiation efficiency, suggesting that IF2 is required for efficient re-initiation. In contrast, overexpression of IF3 led to a marked decrease in re-initiation efficiency, suggesting that a 30S ribosome and not a 70S ribosome is used for translation re-initiation. Strikingly, overexpression of IF3 also blocked E. coli from acting as a host for propagation of M13 phage.},

	Abstract = {A major goal in proteomics is the comprehensive and accurate description of a proteome. This task does not only include the identification of proteins in a sample, but also the accurate quantification of their abundances. While mass spectrometry typically provides information on peptide identity and abundance in the sample, it does not directly measure the concentration of the corresponding proteins. Specifically, most mass spectrometry based approaches - e.g. shotgun proteomics or selected reaction monitoring - allow to quantify peptides using chromatographic peak intensities or spectral counting information. Ultimately, based on these measurements, one wants to infer the concentrations of the corresponding proteins. Inferring properties of the proteins based on experimental peptide evidence is often a complex problem due to ambiguities of peptide assignments and different chemical properties of the peptides that affect observed concentrations. We present SCAMPI, a novel generic and statistically sound framework to compute protein abundance scores based on quantified peptides. In contrast to most previous approaches, our model explicitly includes information from shared peptides to improve protein quantitation especially in eukaryotes with many homologous sequences. The model accounts for uncertainty in the input data, leading to statistical prediction intervals for the protein scores. Furthermore, peptides with extreme abundances can be reassessed and classified as either regular data points or actual outliers. We applied the proposed model on several datasets and compared its performance to other previously used approaches for protein quantification in bottom-up mass spectrometry.},

	Abstract = {Azotobacter vinelandii is a soil bacterium related to the Pseudomonas genus that fixes nitrogen under aerobic conditions while simultaneously protecting nitrogenase from oxygen damage. In response to carbon availability, this organism undergoes a simple differentiation process to form cysts that are resistant to drought and other physical and chemical agents. Here we report the complete genome sequence of A. vinelandii DJ, which has a single circular genome of 5,365,318 bp. In order to reconcile an obligate aerobic lifestyle with exquisitely oxygen-sensitive processes, A. vinelandii is specialized in terms of its complement of respiratory proteins. It is able to produce alginate, a polymer that further protects the organism from excess exogenous oxygen, and it has multiple duplications of alginate modification genes, which may alter alginate composition in response to oxygen availability. The genome analysis identified the chromosomal locations of the genes coding for the three known oxygen-sensitive nitrogenases, as well as genes coding for other oxygen-sensitive enzymes, such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. These findings offer new prospects for the wider application of A. vinelandii as a host for the production and characterization of oxygen-sensitive proteins.},

	Abstract = {Sinorhizobium meliloti can live as a soil saprophyte and can engage in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with plant roots. To succeed in such diverse environments, the bacteria must continually adjust gene expression. Transcriptional plasticity in eubacteria is often mediated by alternative sigma ($\sigma$) factors interacting with core RNA polymerase. The S. meliloti genome encodes 14 of these alternative $\sigma$ factors, including two putative RpoH ("heat shock") $\sigma$ factors. We used custom Affymetrix symbiosis chips to characterize the global transcriptional response of S. meliloti rpoH1, rpoH2, and rpoH1 rpoH2 mutants during heat shock and stationary-phase growth. Under these conditions, expression of over 300 genes is dependent on rpoH1 and rpoH2. We mapped transcript start sites of 69 rpoH-dependent genes using 5' RACE (5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends), which allowed us to determine putative RpoH1-dependent, RpoH2-dependent, and dual-promoter (RpoH1- and RpoH2-dependent) consensus sequences that were each used to search the genome for other potential direct targets of RpoH. The inferred S. meliloti RpoH promoter consensus sequences share features of Escherichia coli RpoH promoters but lack extended -10 motifs.},

Among the sequence datasets from four different samples of marine bacterial metagenomes, we noted that nitrogen fixation (nif) genes were conspicuous by their absence from three of them. However, in one sample, more than one-third of the bacteria appeared to have a complement of these genes.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sigma-54 is a central regulator in many pathogenic bacteria and has been linked to a multitude of cellular processes like nitrogen assimilation and important functional traits such as motility, virulence, and biofilm formation. Until now it has remained obscure whether these phenomena and the control by Sigma-54 share an underlying theme.

RESULTS: We have uncovered the commonality by performing a range of comparative genome analyses. A) The presence of Sigma-54 and its associated activators was determined for all sequenced prokaryotes. We observed a phylum-dependent distribution that is suggestive of an evolutionary relationship between Sigma-54 and lipopolysaccharide and flagellar biosynthesis. B) All Sigma-54 activators were identified and annotated. The relation with phosphotransfer-mediated signaling (TCS and PTS) and the transport and assimilation of carboxylates and nitrogen containing metabolites was substantiated. C) The function annotations, that were represented within the genomic context of all genes encoding Sigma-54, its activators and its promoters, were analyzed for intra-phylum representation and inter-phylum conservation. Promoters were localized using a straightforward scoring strategy that was formulated to identify similar motifs. We found clear highly-represented and conserved genetic associations with genes that concern the transport and biosynthesis of the metabolic intermediates of exopolysaccharides, flagella, lipids, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins and peptidoglycan.

CONCLUSION: Our analyses directly implicate Sigma-54 as a central player in the control over the processes that involve the physical interaction of an organism with its environment like in the colonization of a host (virulence) or the formation of biofilm.},

It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Illumina Infinium whole genome genotyping (WGG) arrays are increasingly being applied in cancer genomics to study gene copy number alterations and allele-specific aberrations such as loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Methods developed for normalization of WGG arrays have mostly focused on diploid, normal samples. However, for cancer samples genomic aberrations may confound normalization and data interpretation. Therefore, we examined the effects of the conventionally used normalization method for Illumina Infinium arrays when applied to cancer samples.

RESULTS: We demonstrate an asymmetry in the detection of the two alleles for each SNP, which deleteriously influences both allelic proportions and copy number estimates. The asymmetry is caused by a remaining bias between the two dyes used in the Infinium II assay after using the normalization method in Illumina's proprietary software (BeadStudio). We propose a quantile normalization strategy for correction of this dye bias. We tested the normalization strategy using 535 individual hybridizations from 10 data sets from the analysis of cancer genomes and normal blood samples generated on Illumina Infinium II 300 k version 1 and 2, 370 k and 550 k BeadChips. We show that the proposed normalization strategy successfully removes asymmetry in estimates of both allelic proportions and copy numbers. Additionally, the normalization strategy reduces the technical variation for copy number estimates while retaining the response to copy number alterations.

CONCLUSION: The proposed normalization strategy represents a valuable tool that improves the quality of data obtained from Illumina Infinium arrays, in particular when used for LOH and copy number variation studies.},

The gene-annotation enrichment analysis is a promising high-throughput strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators to identify biological processes most pertinent to their study. Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach. Thus, the survey will help tool designers/developers and experienced end users understand the underlying algorithms and pertinent details of particular tool categories/tools, enabling them to make the best choices for their particular research interests.},

@article{Chapman2014,
	Abstract = {One of the most important early developments in the field of proteomics was the advent of automated data acquisition routines that allowed high-throughput unattended data acquisition during HPLC introduction of peptide mixtures to a tandem mass spectrometer. Prior to this, data acquisition was orders of magnitude less efficient being based entirely on lists of predetermined ions generated in a prior HPLC-MS experiment. This process, known generically as data-dependent analysis, empowered the development of shotgun proteomics where hundreds to thousands of peptide sequences are matched per experiment. In their most popular implementation, the most abundant ionized species from every precursor ion scan at each moment in chromatographic time are successively selected for isolation, activation and tandem mass analysis. While extremely powerful, this strategy has one primary limitation in that detectable dynamic range is restricted (in a top-down manner) to the peptides that ionize the best. To circumvent the serial nature of the data-dependent process and increase detectable dynamic range, the concepts of multiplexed and data-independent acquisition (DIA) have emerged. Multiplexed-data acquisition is based on more efficient co-selection and co-dissociation of multiple precursor ions in parallel, the data from which is subsequently de-convoluted to provide polypeptide sequences for each individual precursor ion. DIA has similar goals, but there is no real-time ion selection based on prior precursor ion scans. Instead, predefined m/z ranges are interrogated either by fragmenting all ions entering the mass spectrometer at every single point in chromatographic time; or by dividing the m/z range into smaller m/z ranges for isolation and fragmentation. These approaches aim to fully utilize the capabilities of mass spectrometers to maximize tandem MS acquisition time and to address the need to expand the detectable dynamic range, lower the limit of detection, and improve the overall confidence of peptide identifications and relative protein quantification measurements. This review covers all aspects of multiplexed- and data-independent tandem mass spectrometry in proteomics, from experimental implementations to advances in software for data interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: As more and more genomes are being sequenced, an overview of their genomic features and annotation of their functional elements, which control the expression of each gene or transcription unit of the genome, is a fundamental challenge in genomics and bioinformatics.

FINDINGS: Relative stability of DNA sequence has been used to predict promoter regions in 913 microbial genomic sequences with GC-content ranging from 16.6{\%} to 74.9{\%}. Irrespective of the genome GC-content the relative stability based promoter prediction method has already been proven to be robust in terms of recall and precision. The predicted promoter regions for the 913 microbial genomes have been accumulated in a database called PromBase. Promoter search can be carried out in PromBase either by specifying the gene name or the genomic position. Each predicted promoter region has been assigned to a reliability class (low, medium, high, very high and highest) based on the difference between its average free energy and the downstream region. The recall and precision values for each class are shown graphically in PromBase. In addition, PromBase provides detailed information about base composition, CDS and CG/TA skews for each genome and various DNA sequence dependent structural properties (average free energy, curvature and bendability) in the vicinity of all annotated translation start sites (TLS).

CONCLUSION: PromBase is a database, which contains predicted promoter regions and detailed analysis of various genomic features for 913 microbial genomes. PromBase can serve as a valuable resource for comparative genomics study and help the experimentalist to rapidly access detailed information on various genomic features and putative promoter regions in any given genome. This database is freely accessible for academic and non- academic users via the worldwide web http://nucleix.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/prombase/.},

@article{Gonzalez2003,
	Abstract = {Background Symbiotic bacteria known as rhizobia interact with the roots of legumes and induce the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules. In rhizobia, essential genes for symbiosis are compartmentalized either in symbiotic plasmids or in chromosomal symbiotic islands. To understand the structure and evolution of the symbiotic genome compartments (SGCs), it is necessary to analyze their common genetic content and organization as well as to study their differences. To date, five SGCs belonging to distinct species of rhizobia have been entirely sequenced. We report the complete sequence of the symbiotic plasmid of Rhizobium etli CFN42, a microsymbiont of beans, and a comparison with other SGC sequences available. Results The symbiotic plasmid is a circular molecule of 371,255 base-pairs containing 359 coding sequences. Nodulation and nitrogen-fixation genes common to other rhizobia are clustered in a region of 125 kilobases. Numerous sequences related to mobile elements are scattered throughout. In some cases the mobile elements flank blocks of functionally related sequences, thereby suggesting a role in transposition. The plasmid contains 12 reiterated DNA families that are likely to participate in genomic rearrangements. Comparisons between this plasmid and complete rhizobial genomes and symbiotic compartments already sequenced show a general lack of synteny and colinearity, with the exception of some transcriptional units. There are only 20 symbiotic genes that are shared by all SGCs. Conclusions Our data support the notion that the symbiotic compartments of rhizobia genomes are mosaic structures that have been frequently tailored by recombination, horizontal transfer and transposition.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delineating the molecular drivers of cancer, i.e. determining cancer genes and the pathways which they deregulate, is an important challenge in cancer research. In this study, we aim to identify pathways of frequently mutated genes by exploiting their network neighborhood encoded in the protein-protein interaction network. To this end, we introduce a multi-scale diffusion kernel and apply it to a large collection of murine retroviral insertional mutagenesis data. The diffusion strength plays the role of scale parameter, determining the size of the network neighborhood that is taken into account. As a result, in addition to detecting genes with frequent mutations in their genomic vicinity, we find genes that harbor frequent mutations in their interaction network context. RESULTS: We identify densely connected components of known and putatively novel cancer genes and demonstrate that they are strongly enriched for cancer related pathways across the diffusion scales. Moreover, the mutations in the clusters exhibit a significant pattern of mutual exclusion, supporting the conjecture that such genes are functionally linked. Using multi-scale diffusion kernel, various infrequently mutated genes are found to harbor significant numbers of mutations in their interaction network neighborhood. Many of them are well-known cancer genes. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the importance of defining recurrent mutations while taking into account the interaction network context. Importantly, the putative cancer genes and networks detected in this study are found to be significant at different diffusion scales, confirming the necessity of a multi-scale analysis.},

	Abstract = {In order to investigate the symbiotic interaction between soybean and Bradyrhizobium japonicum, TnphoA mutagenesis of the microsymbiont was performed. Mutant strain 2-10 was found to induce a strongly reduced number of ineffective nodules. Ultrastructural analysis of the soybean nodule central tissue revealed the presence of numerous starch granules and vacuoles in the infected cells. In addition, the number of symbiosomes was extremely low, indicating an impaired interaction between the plant and invading bacteria. Cloning and sequencing of the mutated DNA region uncovered four open reading frames (ORFs) lacking any data base similarities. ORFs srrA1 and srrA2, the 2-10 TnphoA insertion site, are encoded in the same reading frame. A 35-kDa expression product in Escherichia coli indicated the presence of a common protein, called SrrA (symbiotically relevant region) in B. japonicum 110spc4, encoded by combined srrA1 and srrA2 genes. The analysis of gene disruption mutants revealed that srrB and srrC were also required for effective symbiosis with soybeans. Further downstream the gene for a putative inner membrane protein (pipA) of unknown function was encoded on the opposite strand. Primer extension studies led to the conclusion that the organization of genes differed from the RhizoBase annotation in this particular region of B. japonicum USDA110.},

@article{Marintchev:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Translation, the process of mRNA-encoded protein synthesis, requires a complex apparatus, composed of the ribosome, tRNAs and additional protein factors, including aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The ribosome provides the platform for proper assembly of mRNA, tRNAs and protein factors and carries the peptidyl-transferase activity. It consists of small and large subunits. The ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein particles with a ribosomal RNA core, to which multiple ribosomal proteins are bound. The sequence and structure of ribosomal RNAs, tRNAs, some of the ribosomal proteins and some of the additional protein factors are conserved in all kingdoms, underlying the common origin of the translation apparatus. Translation can be subdivided into several steps: initiation, elongation, termination and recycling. Of these, initiation is the most complex and the most divergent among the different kingdoms of life. A great amount of new structural, biochemical and genetic information on translation initiation has been accumulated in recent years, which led to the realization that initiation also shows a great degree of conservation throughout evolution. In this review, we summarize the available structural and functional data on translation initiation in the context of evolution, drawing parallels between eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We will start with an overview of the ribosome structure and of translation in general, placing emphasis on factors and processes with relevance to initiation. The major steps in initiation and the factors involved will be described, followed by discussion of the structure and function of the individual initiation factors throughout evolution. We will conclude with a summary of the available information on the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of translation initiation.},

@article{Worth1994,
	Abstract = {Bacterial mutS and mutL mutations confer large increases in recombination between sequences that are divergent by several percent at the nucleotide level, an effect attributed to a role for products of these genes in control of recombination fidelity. Since MutS and MutL are proteins involved in the earliest steps of mismatch repair, including mismatch recognition by MutS, we have tested the possibility that they may affect strand exchange in response to occurrence of mispairs within the recombination heteroduplex. We show that MutS abolishes RecA-catalyzed strand transfer between fd and M13 bacteriophage DNAs, which vary by 3{\%} at the nucleotide level, but is without effect on M13-M13 or fd-fd exchange. Although MutL alone has no effect on M13-fd heteroduplex formation, the protein dramatically enhances the inhibition of strand transfer mediated by MutS. Analysis of strand-transfer intermediates that accumulate in the presence of MutS and MutL indicates that the proteins block branch migration, presumably in response to occurrence of mispairs within newly formed heteroduplex.},

	Abstract = {Using whole genome arrays, we systematically investigated nitrogen regulation in the plant symbiotic bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The use of glutamate instead of ammonium as a nitrogen source induced nitrogen catabolic genes independently of the carbon source, including two glutamine synthetase genes, various aminoacid transporters and the glnKamtB operon. These responses depended on both the ntrC and glnB nitrogen regulators. Glutamate repressible genes included glutamate synthase and a H+-translocating pyrophosphate synthase. The smc01041-ntrBC operon was negatively autoregulated in a glnB-dependent fashion, indicating an involvement of phosphorylated NtrC. In addition to the nitrogen response, glutamate remodelled expression of carbon metabolism by inhibiting expression of the Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways, and by stimulating gluconeogenetic genes independently of ntrC.},

@article{Biron2006,
	Abstract = {The elucidation of the entire genomic sequence of various organisms, from viruses to complex metazoans, most recently man, is undoubtedly the greatest triumph of molecular biology since the discovery of the DNA double helix. Over the past two decades, the focus of molecular biology has gradually moved from genomes to proteomes, the intention being to discover the functions of the genes themselves. The postgenomic era stimulated the development of new techniques (e.g. 2-DE and MS) and bioinformatics tools to identify the functions, reactions, interactions and location of the gene products in tissues and/or cells of living organisms. Both 2-DE and MS have been very successfully employed to identify proteins involved in biological phenomena (e.g. immunity, cancer, host-parasite interactions, etc.), although recently, several papers have emphasised the pitfalls of 2-DE experiments, especially in relation to experimental design, poor statistical treatment and the high rate of 'false positive' results with regard to protein identification. In the light of these perceived problems, we review the advantages and misuses of bioinformatics tools - from realisation of 2-DE gels to the identification of candidate protein spots - and suggest some useful avenues to improve the quality of 2-DE experiments. In addition, we present key steps which, in our view, need to be to taken into consideration during such analyses. Lastly, we present novel biological entities named 'interactomes', and the bioinformatics tools developed to analyse the large protein-protein interaction networks they form, along with several new perspectives of the field.},

@article{Gonzalez:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We report the complete 6,530,228-bp genome sequence of the symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacterium Rhizobium etli. Six large plasmids comprise one-third of the total genome size. The chromosome encodes most functions necessary for cell growth, whereas few essential genes or complete metabolic pathways are located in plasmids. Chromosomal synteny is disrupted by genes related to insertion sequences, phages, plasmids, and cell-surface components. Plasmids do not show synteny, and their orthologs are mostly shared by accessory replicons of species with multipartite genomes. Some nodulation genes are predicted to be functionally related with chromosomal loci encoding for the external envelope of the bacterium. Several pieces of evidence suggest an exogenous origin for the symbiotic plasmid (p42d) and p42a. Additional putative horizontal gene transfer events might have contributed to expand the adaptive repertoire of R. etli, because they include genes involved in small molecule metabolism, transport, and transcriptional regulation. Twenty-three putative sigma factors, numerous isozymes, and paralogous families attest to the metabolic redundancy and the genomic plasticity necessary to sustain the lifestyle of R. etli in symbiosis and in the soil.},

@article{Laalami:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The instability of messenger RNA is fundamental to the control of gene expression. In bacteria, mRNA degradation generally follows an "all-or-none" pattern. This implies that if control is to be efficient, it must occur at the initiating (and presumably rate-limiting) step of the degradation process. Studies of E. coli and B. subtilis, species separated by 3 billion years of evolution, have revealed the principal and very disparate enzymes involved in this process in the two organisms. The early view that mRNA decay in these two model organisms is radically different has given way to new models that can be resumed by "different enzymes-similar strategies". The recent characterization of key ribonucleases sheds light on an impressive case of convergent evolution that illustrates that the surprisingly similar functions of these totally unrelated enzymes are of general importance to RNA metabolism in bacteria. We now know that the major mRNA decay pathways initiate with an endonucleolytic cleavage in E. coli and B. subtilis and probably in many of the currently known bacteria for which these organisms are considered representative. We will discuss here the different pathways of eubacterial mRNA decay, describe the major players and summarize the events that can precede and/or favor nucleolytic inactivation of a mRNA, notably the role of the 5' end and translation initiation. Finally, we will discuss the role of subcellular compartmentalization of transcription, translation, and the RNA degradation machinery.},

@article{Richard2004,
	Abstract = {It was previously shown that the Rhodobacter capsulatus NtrC enhancer-binding protein activates the R. capsulatus housekeeping RNA polymerase but not the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the nifA1 promoter. We have tested the hypothesis that this activity is due to the high GC content of the 10 sequence. A comparative analysis of R. capsulatus and other -proteobacterial promoters with known transcription start sites suggests that the GC content of the 10 region is higher than that for E. coli. Both in vivo and in vitro results obtained with nifA1 promoters with 10 and/or 35 variations are reported here. A major conclusion of this study is that -proteobacteria have evolved a promiscuous sigma factor and core RNA polymerase that can transcribe promoters with high-GC 10 regions in addition to the classic E. coli Pribnow box. To facilitate studies of R. capsulatus transcription, we cloned and overexpressed all of the RNA polymerase subunits in E. coli, and these were reconstituted in vitro to form an active, recombinant R. capsulatus RNA polymerase with properties mimicking those of the natural polymerase. Thus, no additional factors from R. capsulatus are necessary for the recognition of high-GC promoters or for activation by R. capsulatus NtrC. The addition of R. capsulatus 70 to the E. coli core RNA polymerase or the use of 10 promoter mutants did not facilitate R. capsulatus NtrC activation of the nifA1 promoter by the E. coli RNA polymerase. Thus, an additional barrier to activation by R. capsulatus NtrC exists, probably a lack of the proper R. capsulatus NtrC-E. coli RNA polymerase (protein-protein) interaction(s)},

	Abstract = {Bacteria live in an ever-changing environment and must alter protein expression promptly to adapt to these changes and survive. Specific response genes that are regulated by a subset of alternative $\sigma$(70)-like transcription factors have evolved in order to respond to this changing environment. Recently, we have described the existence of a $\sigma$(E) regulon including the anti-$\sigma$-factor MseR in the obligate human bacterial pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. To unravel the complete $\sigma$(E) regulon in N. meningitidis, we sequenced total RNA transcriptional content of wild type meningococci and compared it with that of mseR mutant cells ($\Delta$mseR) in which $\sigma$(E) is highly expressed. Eleven coding genes and one non-coding gene were found to be differentially expressed between H44/76 wildtype and H44/76$\Delta$mseR cells. Five of the 6 genes of the $\sigma$(E) operon, msrA/msrB, and the gene encoding a pepSY-associated TM helix family protein showed enhanced transcription, whilst aniA encoding a nitrite reductase and nspA encoding the vaccine candidate Neisserial surface protein A showed decreased transcription. Analysis of differential expression in IGRs showed enhanced transcription of a non-coding RNA molecule, identifying a $\sigma$(E) dependent small non-coding RNA. Together this constitutes the first complete exploration of an alternative $\sigma$-factor regulon in N. meningitidis. The results direct to a relatively small regulon indicative for a strictly defined response consistent with a relatively stable niche, the human throat, where N. meningitidis resides.},

@article{Jacques2006,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In bacteria, sigma factors and other transcriptional regulatory proteins recognize DNA patterns upstream of their target genes and interact with RNA polymerase to control transcription. As a consequence of evolution, DNA sequences recognized by transcription factors are thought to be enriched in intergenic regions (IRs) and depleted from coding regions of prokaryotic genomes.

RESULTS: In this work, we report that genomic distribution of transcription factors binding sites is biased towards IRs, and that this bias is conserved amongst bacterial species. We further take advantage of this observation to develop an algorithm that can efficiently identify promoter boxes by a distribution-dependent approach rather than a direct sequence comparison approach. This strategy, which can easily be combined with other methodologies, allowed the identification of promoter sequences in ten species and can be used with any annotated bacterial genome, with results that rival with current methodologies. Experimental validations of predicted promoters also support our approach.

CONCLUSION: Considering that complete genomic sequences of over 1000 bacteria will soon be available and that little transcriptional information is available for most of them, our algorithm constitutes a promising tool for the prediction of promoter sequences. Importantly, our methodology could also be adapted to identify DNA sequences recognized by other regulatory proteins.},

	Abstract = {The ability to fix nitrogen is widely, but sporadically distributed among the Bacteria and Archaea suggesting either a vertically inherited, ancient function with widespread loss across genera or an adaptive feature trans- ferred laterally between co-inhabitants of nitrogen-poor environments. As previous phylogenetic studies of nifH and nifD have not completely resolved the evolutionary history of nitrogenase, sixty nifD, nifK, and combined nifDK genes were analyzed using Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and parsimony algorithms to determine whether the individual andcombined datasets could provide additional information. The results show congruence between the 16S and nifDK phylogenies at the phyla level and generally support vertical descent with loss. However, statistically significant differ- ences between tree topographies suggest a complex evolu- tionary history with the underlyingpattern of vertical descent obscured by recurring lateral transfer events and different patterns of evolution between the genes. Results support inheritance from the Last Common ancestor or an ancient lateral transfer of the nif genes between Bacteria and Ar- chaea, ongoing gene transfer between cohabitants of similar biogeographic regions, acquisition of nitrogen-fixing capa- bility via symbiosis islands, possible xenologous displace- ment of one gene in the operon, and possible retention of ancestral genes in heterocystous cyanobacteria. Analyses support the monophyly of the Cyanobacteria, abc-Proteo- bacteria, and Actinobacteria (Frankia) and provide strong support for the placement of Frankia nif genes at the base of combined the Cyanobacteria/Proteobacteria clades.},

@article{Panyukov2013,
	Abstract = {Expression of bacterial genes takes place under the control of RNA polymerase with exchangeable $\sigma$-subunits and multiple transcription factors. A typical promoter region contains one or several overlapping promoters. In the latter case promoters have the same or different $\sigma$-specificity and are often subjected to different regulatory stimuli. Genes, transcribed from multiple promoters, have on average higher expression levels. However, recently in the genome of Escherichia coli we found 78 regions with an extremely large number of potential transcription start points (promoter islands, PIs). It was shown that all PIs interact with RNA polymerase in vivo and are able to form transcriptionally competent open complexes both in vitro and in vivo but their transcriptional activity measured by oligonucleotide microarrays was very low, if any. Here we confirmed transcriptional defectiveness of PIs by analyzing the 5'-end specific RNA-seq data, but showed their ability to produce short oligos (9-14 bases). This combination of functional properties indicated a deliberate suppression of transcriptional activity within PIs. According to our data this suppression may be due to a specific conformation of the DNA double helix, which provides an ideal platform for interaction with both RNA polymerase and the histone-like nucleoid protein H-NS. The genomic DNA of E.coli contains therefore several dozen sites optimized by evolution for staying in a heterochromatin-like state. Since almost all promoter islands are associated with horizontally acquired genes, we offer them as specific components of bacterial evolution involved in acquisition of foreign genetic material by turning off the expression of toxic or useless aliens or by providing optimal promoter for beneficial genes. The putative molecular mechanism underlying the appearance of promoter islands within recipient genomes is discussed.},

One often overlooked complication with such studies is batch effects, which occur because measurements are affected by laboratory conditions, reagent lots and personnel differences. This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address.

Using a sensitive geLC-MS/MS proteomics approach, we report the identification of 2315 B. japonicum strain USDA110 proteins (27.8{\%} of the theoretical proteome) that are expressed 21 days post infection in symbiosis with soybean cultivated in growth chambers, substantially expanding the previously known symbiosis proteome. Integration of transcriptomics data generated under the same conditions (2780 expressed genes) allowed us to compile a comprehensive expression profile of B. japonicum during soybean symbiosis, which comprises 3587 genes/proteins (43{\%} of the predicted B. japonicum genes/proteins). Analysis of this data set revealed both the biases and the complementarity of these global profiling technologies. A functional classification and pathway analysis showed that most of the proteins involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism are expressed, including a complete set of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, several gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, as well as several proteins that were previously not considered to be present during symbiosis. Congruent results were obtained for B. japonicum bacteroids harvested from soybeans grown under field conditions.},

	Abstract = {Predictive signatures are gene expression profiles that should predict the response of tumors to chemotherapy in patients. Such signatures have been derived from the response of tumor cell lines to chemotherapy, but their usefulness in patients remains controversial, as the most spectacular published signatures are based on unreliable data. We discuss why it is difficult to derive meaningful predictive signatures from cell line panels and we argue that it is implausible that fully predictive signatures can be obtained for classical chemotherapy from oligo-based gene expression arrays. One reason is that resistance to chemotherapy can be caused by alterations in (the expression of) a single gene. We do not expect that such subtle alterations will be reliably picked up by standard gene expression profiling. We delineate alternative approaches that should be able to yield predictive markers that can be used for optimizing patient treatment.},

The server allows the user to rapidly generate reference sets of regulons and regulatory motif profiles in a group of prokaryotic genomes. The new concept of a cluster of co-regulated orthologous operons allows the user to distribute the analysis of large regulons and to perform the comparative analysis of multiple clusters independently. Two major workflows currently implemented in RegPredict are: (i) regulon reconstruction for a known regulatory motif and (ii) ab initio inference of a novel regulon using several scenarios for the generation of starting gene sets. RegPredict provides a comprehensive collection of manually curated positional weight matrices of regulatory motifs. It is based on genomic sequences, ortholog and operon predictions from the MicrobesOnline. An interactive web interface of RegPredict integrates and presents diverse genomic and functional information about the candidate regulon members from several web resources. RegPredict is freely accessible at http://regpredict.lbl.gov.},

Cells have one housekeeping factor and a variable number of alternative sigma factors that possess different promoter-recognition properties. The cell can choose from its repertoire of sigmas to alter its transcriptional program in response to stress. Recent structural information illuminates the process of initiation and also shows that the two key sigma domains are structurally conserved, even among diverse family members. We use the sigma repertoire of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, and cyanobacteria to illustrate the different strategies utilized to organize transcriptional space using multiple sigma factors.},

	Abstract = {The transcriptional activation of the NifA-dependent sigma(54) promoter of the Rhizobium leguminosarum hydrogenase structural genes hupSL (P(1)) has been studied through gel retardation analysis and detailed mutagenesis. Gel retardation analysis indicated the existence of a physical interaction between NifA and the promoter. Extensive mutagenesis followed by in vivo expression analysis showed that three sequences of 4 bases each (-170 ACAA -167, -161 ACAA -158, and -145 TTGT -142) are required for maximal stimulation of in vivo transcription of the P(1) promoter. The arrangement of these upstream activating sequences (ACAA N(5) ACAA N(12) TTGT) differs from the canonical 5'ACA N(10) TGT 3' UAS structure involved in NifA-dependent activation of nif/fix genes. Mutant promoter analysis indicated that the relative contribution of each of these sequences to P(1) promoter activity increases with its proximity to the transcription start site. Analysis of double mutants altered in two out of the three enhancer sequences suggests that each of these sequences functions in NifA-dependent activation of the P(1) promoter in an independent but cooperative mode. The similarities and differences between cis elements of hup and nif/fix promoters suggest that the structure of the P(1) promoter has adapted to activation by NifA in order to coexpress hydrogenase and nitrogenase activities in legume nodules.},

	Abstract = {The rhizobial bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum functions as a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of the soybean plant (Glycine max). Plants are capable of producing an oxidative burst, a rapid proliferation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as a defense mechanism against pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria. Therefore, B. japonicum must be able to resist such a defense mechanism to initiate nodulation. In this study, paraquat, a known superoxide radical-inducing agent, was used to investigate this response. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles were created for both prolonged exposure (PE) and fulminant shock (FS) conditions. These profiles revealed that 190 and 86 genes were up- and downregulated for the former condition, and that 299 and 105 genes were up- and downregulated for the latter condition, respectively ({\textgreater}2.0-fold; P {\textless} 0.05). Many genes within putative operons for F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase, chemotaxis, transport, and ribosomal proteins were upregulated during PE. The transcriptional profile for the FS condition strangely resembled that of a bacteroid condition, including the FixK(2) transcription factor and most of its response elements. However, genes encoding canonical ROS scavenging enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, were not detected, suggesting constitutive expression of those genes by endogenous ROS. Various physiological tests, including exopolysaccharide (EPS), cellular protein, and motility characterization, were performed to corroborate the gene expression data. The results suggest that B. japonicum responds to tolerable oxidative stress during PE through enhanced motility, increased translational activity, and EPS production, in addition to the expression of genes involved in global stress responses, such as chaperones and sigma factors.},

	Abstract = {Deep proteomic analysis of mammalian cell lines would yield an inventory of the building blocks of the most commonly used systems in biological research. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can identify and quantify proteins in a global and unbiased manner and can highlight the cellular processes that are altered between such systems. We analyzed 11 human cell lines using an LTQ-Orbitrap family mass spectrometer with a "high field" Orbitrap mass analyzer with improved resolution and sequencing speed. We identified a total of 11,731 proteins, and on average 10,361 $\pm$ 120 proteins in each cell line. This very high proteome coverage enabled analysis of a broad range of processes and functions. Despite the distinct origins of the cell lines, our quantitative results showed surprisingly high similarity in terms of expressed proteins. Nevertheless, this global similarity of the proteomes did not imply equal expression levels of individual proteins across the 11 cell lines, as we found significant differences in expression levels for an estimated two-third of them. The variability in cellular expression levels was similar for low and high abundance proteins, and even many of the most highly expressed proteins with household roles showed significant differences between cells. Metabolic pathways, which have high redundancy, exhibited variable expression, whereas basic cellular functions such as the basal transcription machinery varied much less. We harness knowledge of these cell line proteomes for the construction of a broad coverage "super-SILAC" quantification standard. Together with the accompanying paper (Schaab, C. MCP 2012, PMID: 22301388) (17) these data can be used to obtain reference expression profiles for proteins of interest both within and across cell line proteomes.},

	Abstract = {Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is one of the most widely used tumor markers, and strongly correlates with the risk of harboring from prostate cancer (PCa). This risk is visible already several years in advance but PSA has severe limitations for PCa detection with its low specificity and low negative predictive value. There is an urgent need for new biomarkers especially to detect clinically significant and aggressive PCa. From all PSA-based markers, the FDA-approved Prostate Health Index (phi) shows improved specificity over percent free and total PSA. Other serum kallikreins or sarcosine in serum or urine show more diverging data. In urine, the FDA-approved prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) has also proven its utility in the detection and management of early PCa. However, some aspects on its correlation with aggressiveness and the low sensitivity at very high values have to be re-examined. The detection of a fusion of the androgen regulated TMPRSS2 gene with the ERG oncogene (from the ETS family), which acts as transcription factor gene, in tissue of {\~{}}50{\%} of all PCa patients was one milestone in PCa research. When combining the urinary assays for TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3, an improved accuracy for PCa detection is visible. PCA3 and phi as the best available PCa biomarkers show an equal performance in direct comparisons.},

The aims of this study are primarily on the providing functional clues to M. loti proteins that are relevant to symbiotic nitrogen fixation and conserved in other rhizobium species, especially proteins with regulatory functions and unannotated proteins. By the screening of 1542 genes as bait, 3121 independent interactions involving 1804 proteins (24{\%} of the total protein coding genes) were identified and each interaction was evaluated using an interaction generality (IG) measure and the general features of the interacting partners. Most PPIs detected in this study are novel interactions revealing potential functional relationships between genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and signal transduction. Furthermore, we have predicted the putative functions of unannotated proteins through their interactions with known proteins. The results described here represent new insight into protein network of M. loti and provide useful experimental clues to elucidate the biological function of rhizobial genes that can not be assigned directly from their genomic sequence.},

	Abstract = {Chemoprevention is the use of agents to slow progression of, reverse, or inhibit carcinogenesis thereby lowering the risk of developing invasive or clinically significant disease. With its long latency, high incidence and significant morbidity and mortality, prostate cancer is a relevant target for chemoprevention. Developing rational chemopreventive strategies for prostate cancer requires well-characterized agents, suitable cohorts, and reliable intermediate biomarkers of cancer. Chemopreventive agent requirements are experimental or epidemiologic data showing efficacy, safety on chronic administration, and a mechanistic rationale for activity. Current promising agents include antiandrogens and antiestrogens; steroid aromatase inhibitors; retinoids and their modulators; 5??-reductase inhibitors; vitamins D, E, and analogs; selenium compounds; carotenoids; soy isoflavones; dehydroepiandrostenedione and analogs; 2-difluoromethylornithine; lipoxygenase inhibitors; apoptosis inducers; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Identifying biomarkers and validating them as surrogate endpoints for cancer incidence are critical for prostate chemoprevention trials. Potentially useful biomarkers for prostate chemoprevention are associated with histologic, proliferative, differentiation-related, biochemical, and genetic/regulatory features of prostatic disease. In that the prostate is not easily visualized, critical issues also include adequacy and consistency of tissue sampling. Various drugs for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer are now under evaluation in phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. Cohort selection should be based on various patient characteristics (stage of the disease, previous cancers or premalignant lesions, or high risk factors) and should be conducted within the context of standard treatment. ?? 2001, Elsevier Science Inc.},

@article{Boyd2011,
	Abstract = {Mounting evidence indicates the presence of a near complete biological nitrogen cycle in redox-stratified oceans during the late Archean to early Proterozoic (c. 2.5-2.0 Ga). It has been suggested that the iron (Fe)- or vanadium (V)-dependent nitrogenase rather than molybdenum (Mo)-dependent form was responsible for dinitrogen fixation during this time because oceans were depleted in Mo and rich in Fe. We evaluated this hypothesis by examining the phylogenetic relationships of proteins that are required for the biosynthesis of the active site cofactor of Mo-nitrogenase in relation to structural proteins required for Fe-, V- and Mo-nitrogenase. The results are highly suggestive that among extant nitrogen-fixing organisms for which genomic information exists, Mo-nitrogenase is unlikely to have been associated with the Last Universal Common Ancestor. Rather, the origin of Mo-nitrogenase can be traced to an ancestor of the anaerobic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens with acquisition in the bacterial domain via lateral gene transfer involving an anaerobic member of the Firmicutes. A comparison of substitution rates estimated for proteins required for the biosynthesis of the nitrogenase active site cofactor and for a set of paralogous proteins required for the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll suggests that Nif emerged from a nitrogenase-like ancestor approximately 1.5-2.2 Ga. An origin and ensuing proliferation of Mo-nitrogenase under anoxic conditions would likely have occurred in an environment where anaerobic methanogens and Firmicutes coexisted and where Mo was at least episodically available, such as in a redox-stratified Proterozoic ocean basin.},

	Abstract = {Data on 72 non-pigmented bacterial strains that specifically induce nitrogen-fixing root nodules on the legume species Crotalaria glaucoides, Crotalaria perrottetii and Crotalaria podocarpa are reviewed. By SDS-PAGE analysis of total protein patterns and by 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP, these strains form a homogeneous group that is separate from other legume root-nodule-forming bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny indicates that these bacteria belong to the genus Methylobacterium. They can grow on C(1) compounds such as methanol, formate and formaldehyde but not methylamine as sole carbon source, and carry an mxaF gene, encoding methanol dehydrogenase, which supports their methylotrophic metabolism. Presence of a nodA nodulation gene, and ability to nodulate plants of Crotalaria species and to fix nitrogen are features that separate the strains currently included in this group from other members of the genus Methylobacterium. The present study includes additional genotypic and phenotypic characterization of this novel Methylobacterium species, i.e. nifH gene sequence, morphology, physiology, enzymic and carbon source assimilation tests and antibiotic resistance. The name Methylobacterium nodulans sp. nov. (type strain, ORS 2060(T)=CNCM I 2342(T)=LMG 21967(T)) is proposed for this group of root-nodule-forming bacteria.},

	Abstract = {Regulation of gene expression at the level of translation accounts for up to three orders of magnitude in its efficiency. We systematically compared the impact of several mRNA features on translation initiation at the first gene in an operon with those for the second gene. Experiments were done in a system with internal control based on dual cerulean and red (CER/RFP) fluorescent proteins. We demonstrated significant differences in the efficiency of Shine Dalgarno sequences acting at the leading gene and at the following genes in an operon. The majority of frequent intercistronic arrangements possess medium SD dependence, medium dependence on the preceding cistron translation and efficient stimulation by A/U-rich sequences. The second cistron starting immediately after preceding cistron stop codon displays unusually high dependence on the SD sequence.},

However, both techniques involve extensive data processing, which can be performed by a multitude of different software solutions. Analysis of quantitative LC-MS/MS data is mainly performed in three major steps: processing of raw data, normalization, and statistical analysis. To evaluate the impact of data processing steps, we developed two new benchmark data sets, one each for DDA and SRM, with samples consisting of a long-range dilution series of synthetic peptides spiked in a total cell protein digest. The generated data were processed by eight different software workflows and three postprocessing steps. The results show that the choice of the raw data processing software and the postprocessing steps play an important role in the final outcome. Also, the lin...},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: Ergatis is a flexible workflow management system for designing and executing complex bioinformatics pipelines. However, its complexity restricts its usage to only highly skilled bioinformaticians. We have developed a web-based prokaryotic genome annotation server, Integrative Services for Genomics Analysis (ISGA), which builds upon the Ergatis workflow system, integrates other dynamic analysis tools and provides intuitive web interfaces for biologists to customize and execute their own annotation pipelines. ISGA is designed to be installed at genomics core facilities and be used directly by biologists.

AVAILABILITY: ISGA is accessible at http://isga.cgb.indiana.edu/ and the system is also freely available for local installation.},

@article{Gon:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Exposure of Escherichia coli to UV light increases expression of NrdAB, the major ribonucleotide reductase leading to a moderate increase in dNTP levels. The role of elevated dNTP levels during translesion synthesis (TLS) across specific replication-blocking lesions was investigated. Here we show that although the specialized DNA polymerase PolV is necessary for replication across UV-lesions, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photoproduct, Pol V per se is not sufficient. Indeed, efficient TLS additionally requires elevated dNTP levels. Similarly, for the bypass of an N-2-acetylaminofluorene-guanine adduct that requires Pol II instead of PolV, efficient TLS is only observed under conditions of high dNTP levels. We suggest that increased dNTP levels transiently modify the activity balance of Pol III (i.e., increasing the polymerase and reducing the proofreading functions). Indeed, we show that the stimulation of TLS by elevated dNTP levels can be mimicked by genetic inactivation of the proofreading function (mutD5 allele). We also show that spontaneous mutagenesis increases proportionally to dNTP pool levels, thus defining a unique spontaneous mutator phenotype. The so-called "dNTP mutator" phenotype does not depend upon any of the specialized DNA polymerases, and is thus likely to reflect an increase in Pol III's own replication errors because of the modified activity balance of Pol III. As up-regulation of the dNTP pool size represents a common physiological response to DNA damage, the present model is likely to represent a general and unique paradigm for TLS pathways in many organisms.},

We examine the range of architectures found at activator-dependent promoters and outline the mechanisms by which input from different factors is integrated. Alternatively, activation can be due to factors that interact with RNA polymerase and change its preferences for target promoters.

	Abstract = {Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. Although increased expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an effective indicator for the recurrence of PCa, its intended use as a screening marker for PCa is of considerable controversy. Recent research efforts in the field of PCa biomarkers have focused on the identification of tissue and fluid-based biomarkers that would be better able to stratify those individuals diagnosed with PCa who (i) might best receive no treatment (active surveillance of the disease); (ii) would benefit from existing treatments; or (iii) those who are likely to succumb to disease recurrence and/or have aggressive disease. The growing demand for better prostate cancer biomarkers has coincided with the development of improved discovery and evaluation technologies for multiplexed measurement of proteins in bio-fluids and tissues. This review aims to (i) provide an overview of these technologies as well as describe some of the candidate PCa protein biomarkers that have been discovered using them; (ii) address some of the general limitations in the clinical evaluation and validation of protein biomarkers; and (iii) make recommendations for strategies that could be adopted to improve the successful development of protein biomarkers to deliver improvements in personalized PCa patient decision making.},

	Abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

@article{Valladares:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The PipX factor is a regulatory protein that seems to occur only in cyanobacteria. In the filamentous, heterocyst-forming Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, open reading frame (ORF) asr0485, identified as the pipX gene, is expressed mainly under conditions of combined-nitrogen deprivation dependent on the global N regulator NtcA and the heterocyst-specific regulator HetR. Primer extension and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analyses detected three transcription start points corresponding to a canonical NtcA-activated promoter (to which direct binding of NtcA was observed), an NtcA- and HetR-dependent promoter, and a consensus-type promoter, the last with putative -35 and -10 determinants. Activation of pipX took place in cells differentiating into heterocysts at intermediate to late stages of the process. Accordingly, disruption of pipX led to impaired diazotrophic growth, reduced nitrogenase activity, and impaired activation of the nitrogenase structural genes. The nitrogenase activity of the mutant was low under oxic conditions, likely resulting from inefficient protection against oxygen. In line with this, the activation of the coxB2A2C2 and coxB3A3C3 operons, encoding heterocyst-specific terminal respiratory oxidases responsible for internal oxygen removal, was deficient in the pipX mutant. Therefore, the Anabaena PipX factor shows a spatiotemporal specificity contributing to normal heterocyst function, including full activation of the nitrogenase structural genes and genes of the nitrogenase-protective features of the heterocyst.},

	Abstract = {The typical difficulties associated with the detection of acidic peptides (i.e., those with low isoelectric points (pI)) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) represent a challenge in some proteomic analyses. Here, reverse micelle-forming amphiphilic homopolymers with positively charged interiors are synthesized and used to selectively enrich low pI peptides from complex mixtures for MALDI-MS detection. When using these polymers, acidic proteolytic peptides that are undetectable during normal MALDI-MS analysis are selectively detected. We show that enrichment of these low pI peptides allows acidic proteins to be selectively targeted for detection in multiprotein digests. In addition, the presence of the positively charged polymers during MALDI-MS analyses enhances peptide ion signals by almost an order of magnitude, thereby achieving reproducible ion signals for acidic peptides at concentrations as low as 100 fM. Concurrent detection of acidic and basic peptides was also facilitated by utilizing a sequential extraction process involving reverse micelle forming polymers with positively and negatively charged interiors.},

	Abstract = {The NifA-RpoN complex is a master regulator of the nitrogen fixation genes in alpha-proteobacteria. Based on the complete Rhizobium etli genome sequence, we constructed the R. etli CFN42 oligonucleotide (70 mer) microarray, and utilized this tool and RT-PCR analysis (transcriptomics), proteomics and bioinformatics, with the aim of deciphering the NifA-RpoN regulon under microaerobic conditions (free life) and in symbiosis with bean plants. The R. etli NifA-RpoN regulon was delimited to 78 genes including those involved in nitrogen fixation, revealing 42 new NifA-RpoN dependent genes. More importantly, this study demonstrates that the NifA-RpoN regulon is composed of genes and proteins with very diverse functions, that play a fundamental and heretofore less appreciated role in regulating the normal physiology of the cell and with important functions in providing adequate conditions for efficient nitrogen fixation in symbiosis. The R. etli NifA-RpoN regulon defined here has some components in common with other NifA-RpoN regulons described previously, but, a vast majority is exclusive to the R. etli regulon, suggesting a specific role in this bacteria and particular requirements during nitrogen fixation in comparison with other symbiotic bacterial models.},

	Abstract = {From nucleotide sequencing analyses, the A. caulinodans nifA gene seems to be under dual control by the Ntr (in response to available N) and Fnr (in response to available O2) transcriptional activation/repression systems. Because it fixes N2 in two contexts, the Ntr system might regulate A. caulinodans nif gene expression ex planta, while the Fnr system might similarly regulate in planta. As nifA upstream-activating elements, we have identified: (i) a gpNifA binding site allowing autogenous nifA regulation, (ii) an Ntr-dependent transcription start, presumably the target of gpNifA activation, and (iii) an "anaerobox" tetradecameric nucleotide sequence that is precisely conserved among O2 regulated enteric bacterial genes controlled by the gpFnr transcriptional activator. Because it is precisely positioned upstream of enteric bacterial transcriptional starts, the "anaerobox" sequence may constitute the gpFnr DNA binding site. If so, then a second, Ntr-independent nifA transcription start may exist. We have also deduced the A. caulinodans nifA open reading frame and have compared the gene product (gpNifA) with those of other N2-fixing organisms. These proteins exhibit strongly conserved motifs: (i) sites conserved among ATP-binding proteins, (ii) an interdomain linker region, and (iii) a C-terminal alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix DNA binding site.},

	Abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequence of the A. brasilense fixA, fixB, fixC, and fixX genes is reported here. Sequence similarities between the protein sequences deduced from fixABCX genes and many electron transfer flavoproteins (ETFs) have been noted. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of both subunits of ETF with the A. brasilense fixA and fixB gene products exhibits an identity of 30{\%}. The amino acid sequence of the other two genes, fixC and fixX, revealed similarity with the membrane-bound electron transfer flavoprotein ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO). Using site-directed mutagenesis, mutations were introduced in the fixA promoter element of the A. brasilense fixABCX operon and chimeric p fixA-lacZ reporter gene fusions were constructed. The activation of the fixA promoter of A. brasilense is dependent upon the presence of the NifA protein being approximately 7 times less active than the A. brasilense nifH promoter. These results indicate that NifA from Klebsiella pneumoniae activates the fix promoter of A. brasilense and provide further evidence in support of the regulatory model of NifA activation in A. brasilense. Although no specific function has been assigned to the fixABCX gene products they are apparently required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. An electron-transferring capacity in the nitrogen fixation pathway has been suggested for the fix gene products based on sequence homologies to the ETFs and ETF-QO proteins and by the absence of orthologous electron transfer proteins NifJ and NifF in A. brasilense.},

@article{Sakurai:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The D1 protein of photosystem II in the thylakoid membrane of photosynthetic organisms is encoded by psbA genes, which in cyanobacteria occur in the form of a small gene family. Light-dependent up-regulation of psbA gene expression is crucial to ensure the proper replacement of the D1 protein. To gain a high level of gene expression, psbA transcription can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. Recent transcriptome analyses demonstrated a high number of cis-encoded antisense RNAs (asRNAs) in bacteria, but very little is known about their possible functions. Here, we show the presence of two cis-encoded asRNAs (PsbA2R and PsbA3R) of psbA2 and psbA3 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These asRNAs are located in the 5' untranslated region of psbA2 and psbA3 genes. Their expression becomes up-regulated by light and down-regulated by darkness, similar to their target mRNAs. In the PsbA2R-suppressing strain [PsbA2R(-)], the amount of psbA2 mRNA was only about 50{\%} compared with the control strain. Likewise, we identified a 15{\%} lowered activity of photosystem II and a reduced amount of the D1 protein in PsbA2R(-) compared with the control strain. The function of PsbA2R in the stabilization of psbA2 mRNA was shown from in vitro RNase E assay when the AU box and the ribosome-binding site in the 5' untranslated region of psbA2 mRNA were both covered by PsbA2R. These results add another layer of complexity to the mechanisms that contribute to psbA gene expression and show PsbA2R as a positively acting factor to achieve a maximum level of D1 synthesis.},

	Abstract = {Potential promoters in the genome of Escherichia coli were searched by pattern recognition software PlatProm and classified on the basis of positions relative to gene borders. Beside the expected promoters located in front of the coding sequences we found a considerable amount of intragenic promoter-like signals with a putative ability to drive either antisense or alternative transcription and revealed unusual genomic regions with extremely high density of predicted transcription start points (promoter 'islands'), some of which are located in coding sequences. PlatProm scores converted into probability of RNA polymerase binding demonstrated certain correlation with the enzyme retention registered by ChIP-on-chip technique; however, in 'dense' regions the value of correlation coefficient is lower than throughout the entire genome. Experimental verification confirmed the ability of RNA polymerase to interact and form multiple open complexes within promoter 'island' associated with appY, yet transcription efficiency was lower than might be expected. Analysis of expression data revealed the same tendency for other promoter 'islands', thus assuming functional relevance of non-productive RNA polymerase binding. Our data indicate that genomic DNA of E. coli is enriched by numerous unusual promoter-like sites with biological role yet to be understood.},

	Abstract = {High throughput sequencing of cDNA prepared from RNA, an approach known as RNA-seq, is coming into increasing use as a method for transcriptome analysis. Despite its many advantages, widespread adoption of the technique has been hampered by a lack of easy-to-use, integrated, open source tools for analyzing the nucleotide sequence data that are generated. Here we describe Xpression, an integrated tool for processing prokaryotic RNA-seq data. The tool is easy to use and is fully automated. It performs all essential processing tasks including nucleotide sequence extraction, alignment, quantification, normalization and visualization. Importantly, Xpression processes multiplexed and strand-specific nucleotide sequence data. It extracts and trims specific sequences from files and separately quantifies sense and antisense reads in the final results. Outputs from the tool can also be conveniently used in downstream analysis. In this paper, we show the utility of Xpression to process strand-specific RNA-seq data to identify genes regulated by CouR, a transcription factor that controls p-coumarate degradation by the bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris.},

@article{Guillot2007,
	Abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis spoIIIA locus encodes eight proteins, SpoIIIAA to SpoIIIAH, which are expressed in the mother cell during endospore formation and which are essential for the activation of sigma(G) in the forespore. Complementation studies indicated that this locus may be transcribed from two promoters, one promoter upstream from the first gene and possibly a second unidentified promoter within the locus. Fragments of the spoIIIA locus were expressed at an ectopic site to complement the sporulation-defective phenotype of a spoIIIAH deletion, and we determined that complementation required a fragment of DNA that extended into spoIIIAF. To confirm that there was a promoter located in spoIIIAF, we constructed transcriptional fusions to lacZ and found strong sporulation-induced promoter activity. Primer extension assays were used to determine the transcription start site, and point mutations introduced into the -10 and -35 regions of the promoter reduced its activity. This promoter is transcribed by sigma(E)-RNA polymerase and is repressed by SpoIIID. Therefore, we concluded that the spoIIIA locus is transcribed from two promoters, one at the start of the locus (P1(spoIIIA)) and the other within the locus (P2(spoIIIA)). Based on Campbell integrations and reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the P2(spoIIIA) region, we determined that P2(spoIIIA) is sufficient for transcription of spoIIIAG and spoIIIAH. Inactivation of P2(spoIIIA) blocked spore formation, indicating that P2(spoIIIA) is essential for expression of spoIIIAG and spoIIIAH. The P2(spoIIIA) activity is twice the P1(spoIIIA) activity; therefore, larger amounts of SpoIIIAG and SpoIIIAH than of proteins encoded at the upstream end of the locus may be required.},

	Abstract = {The potential of nitrogen-fixing (NF) bacteria to form a symbiotic relationship with leguminous plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen has been exploited in the field to meet the nitrogen requirement of the latter. This phenomenon provides an alternative to the use of the nitrogenous fertiliser whose excessive and imbalanced use over the decades has contributed to green house emission (N2O) and underground water leaching. Recently, it was observed that non-leguminous plants like rice, sugarcane, wheat and maize form an extended niche for various species of NF bacteria. These bacteria thrive within the plant, successfully colonizing roots, stems and leaves. During the association, the invading bacteria benefit the acquired host with a marked increase in plant growth, vigor and yield. With increasing population, the demand of non-leguminous plant products is growing. In this regard, the richness of NF flora within non-leguminous plants and extent of their interaction with the host definitely shows a ray of hope in developing an ecofriendly alternative to the nitrogenous fertilisers. In this review, we have discussed the association of NF bacteria with various non-leguminous plants emphasizing on their potential to promote host plant growth and yield. In addition, plant growth-promoting traits observed in these NF bacteria and their mode of interaction with the host plant have been described briefly.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alpha proteobacteria are one of the largest and most extensively studied groups within bacteria. However, for these bacteria as a whole and for all of its major subgroups (viz. Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Caulobacterales), very few or no distinctive molecular or biochemical characteristics are known. RESULTS: We have carried out comprehensive phylogenomic analyses by means of Blastp and PSI-Blast searches on the open reading frames in the genomes of several alpha-proteobacteria (viz. Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Brucella suis, Caulobacter crescentus, Gluconobacter oxydans, Mesorhizobium loti, Nitrobacter winogradskyi, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1, Silicibacter sp. TM1040, Rhodospirillum rubrum and Wolbachia (Drosophila) endosymbiont). These studies have identified several proteins that are distinctive characteristics of all alpha-proteobacteria, as well as numerous proteins that are unique repertoires of all of its main orders (viz. Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Caulobacterales) and many families (viz. Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Bradyrhiozobiaceae, Brucellaceae and Bartonellaceae). Many other proteins that are present at different phylogenetic depths in alpha-proteobacteria provide important information regarding their evolution. The evolutionary relationships among alpha-proteobacteria as deduced from these studies are in excellent agreement with their branching pattern in the phylogenetic trees and character compatibility cliques based on concatenated sequences for many conserved proteins. These studies provide evidence that the major groups within alpha-proteobacteria have diverged in the following order: (Rickettsiales(Rhodospirillales (Sphingomonadales (Rhodobacterales (Caulobacterales-Parvularculales (Rhizobiales)))))). We also describe two conserved inserts in DNA Gyrase B and RNA polymerase beta subunit that are distinctive characteristics of the Sphingomonadales and Rhodosprilllales species, respectively. The results presented here also provide support for the grouping of Hyphomonadaceae and Parvularcula species with the Caulobacterales and the placement of Stappia aggregata with the Rhizobiaceae group. CONCLUSION: The alpha-proteobacteria-specific proteins and indels described here provide novel and powerful means for the taxonomic, biochemical and molecular biological studies on these bacteria. Their functional studies should prove helpful in identifying novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are unique to these bacteria.},

@article{Gibbs2013,
	Abstract = {To better understand dynamic disease processes, integrated multi-omic methods are needed, yet comparing different types of omic data remains difficult. Integrative solutions benefit experimenters by eliminating potential biases that come with single omic analysis. We have developed the methods needed to explore whether a relationship exists between co-expression network models built from transcriptomic and proteomic data types, and whether this relationship can be used to improve the disease signature discovery process. A na{\"{i}}ve, correlation based method is utilized for comparison. Using publicly available infectious disease time series data, we analyzed the related co-expression structure of the transcriptome and proteome in response to SARS-CoV infection in mice. Transcript and peptide expression data was filtered using quality scores and subset by taking the intersection on mapped Entrez IDs. Using this data set, independent co-expression networks were built. The networks were integrated by constructing a bipartite module graph based on module member overlap, module summary correlation, and correlation to phenotypes of interest. Compared to the module level results, the na{\"{i}}ve approach is hindered by a lack of correlation across data types, less significant enrichment results, and little functional overlap across data types. Our module graph approach avoids these problems, resulting in an integrated omic signature of disease progression, which allows prioritization across data types for down-stream experiment planning. Integrated modules exhibited related functional enrichments and could suggest novel interactions in response to infection. These disease and platform-independent methods can be used to realize the full potential of multi-omic network signatures. The data (experiment SM001) are publically available through the NIAID Systems Virology (https://www.systemsvirology.org) and PNNL (http://omics.pnl.gov) web portals. Phenotype data is found in the supplementary information. The ProCoNA package is available as part of Bioconductor 2.13.},

@article{Steenhoudt:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Azospirillum represents the best characterized genus of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. Other free-living diazotrophs repeatedly detected in association with plant roots, include Acetobacter diazotrophicus, Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Azoarcus spp. and Azotobacter. Four aspects of the Azospirillum-plant root interaction are highlighted: natural habitat, plant root interaction, nitrogen fixation and biosynthesis of plant growth hormones. Each of these aspects is dealt with in a comparative way. Azospirilla are predominantly surface-colonizing bacteria, whereas A. diazotrophicus, H. seropedicae and Azoarcus sp. are endophytic diazotrophs. The attachment of Azospirillum cells to plant roots occurs in two steps. The polar flagellum, of which the flagellin was shown to be a glycoprotein, mediates the adsorption step. An as yet unidentified surface polysaccharide is believed to be essential in the subsequent anchoring phase. In Azoarcus sp. the attachment process is mediated by type IV pili. Nitrogen fixation structural genes (nif) are highly conserved among all nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and in all diazotrophic species of the class of proteobacteria examined, the transcriptional activator NifA is required for expression of other nif genes in response to two major environmental signals (oxygen and fixed N). However, the mechanisms involved in this control can vary in different organisms. In Azospirillum brasilense and H. seropedicae (alpha- and beta-subgroup, respectively), NifA is inactive in conditions of excess nitrogen. Activation of NifA upon removal of fixed N seems to involve, either directly or indirectly, the signal transduction protein P(II). The presence of four conserved cysteine residues in the NifA protein might be an indication that NifA is directly sensitive to oxygen. In Azotobacter vinelandii (gamma-subgroup) nifA is cotranscribed with a second gene nifL. The nifL gene product inactivates NifA in response to high oxygen tension and cellular nitrogen-status. NifL was found to be a redox-sensitive flavoprotein. The relief of NifL inhibition on NifA activity, in response to N-limitation, is suggested to involve a P(II)-like protein. Moreover, nitrogenase activity is regulated according to the intracellular nitrogen and O(2) level. In A. brasilense and Azospirillum lipoferum posttranslational control of nitrogenase, in response to ammonium and anaerobiosis, involves ADP-ribosylation of the nitrogenase iron protein, mediated by the enzymes DraT and DraG. At least three pathways for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis in A. brasilense exist: two Trp-dependent (the indole-3-pyruvic acid and presumably the indole-3-acetamide pathway) and one Trp-independent pathway. The occurrence of an IAA biosynthetic pathway not using Trp (tryptophan) as precursor is highly unusual in bacteria. Nevertheless, the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase encoding ipdC gene is crucial in the overall IAA biosynthesis in Azospirillum. A number of genes essential for Trp production have been isolated in A. brasilense, including trpE(G) which codes for anthranilate synthase, the key enzyme in Trp biosynthesis. The relevance of each of these four aspects for plant growth promotion by Azospirillum is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Bacterial, small RNAs were once regarded as potent regulators of gene expression and are now being considered as essential for their diversified roles. Many small RNAs are now reported to have a wide array of regulatory functions, ranging from environmental sensing to pathogenesis. Traditionally, noncoding transcripts were rarely detected by means of genetic screens. However, the availability of approximately 2200 prokaryotic genome sequences in public databases facilitates the efficient computational search of those molecules, followed by experimental validation. In principle, the following four major computational methods were applied for the prediction of sRNA locations from bacterial genome sequences: (1) comparative genomics, (2) secondary structure and thermodynamic stability, (3) 'Orphan' transcriptional signals and (4) ab initio methods regardless of sequence or structure similarity; most of these tools were applied to locate the putative genomic sRNA locations followed by experimental validation of those transcripts. Therefore, computational screening has simplified the sRNA identification process in bacteria. In this review, a plethora of small RNA prediction methods and tools that have been reported in the past decade are discussed comprehensively and assessed based on their attributes, compatibility, and their prediction accuracy.},
